it was an equally toxic relationship


[06/01/2023 7:53 PM] Luci#8827
And then blamed it on their age difference


[06/01/2023 7:53 PM] dyl#8086
3 months


[06/01/2023 7:53 PM] Nobody_Likes_Lylac#2457

Nah, stealth bombers are a kind of ebike


[06/03/2023 4:54 PM] sirsen#7894
But you can get em with up to 15kw hub motors


[06/03/2023 4:55 PM] sirsen#7894
Like they'll  do 80mph, but still have pedals


[06/03/2023 4:58 PM] sirsen#7894
Most have like 7kw-10kw tho


[06/03/2023 4:59 PM] sirsen#7894

190 would be ideal,  with a 5 speed and a clutch, but I can do 500 miles on a 50 o reckon,  it's slower coastal roads too

Hey, intimidation is a form of it, as is feigning a retreat to lead someone into an ambush


[06/04/2023 5:25 PM] _leek#0000
absinthe has more of a non-specific sweet taste


[06/04/2023 5:26 PM] Mossman#5168
I quite like anise


[06/04/2023 5:26 PM] Mossman#5168
Isn't it wormwood


[06/04/2023 5:26 PM] Krilalaris#7579
if you mix it with coke it kinda just tastes like vanilla


[06/04/2023 5:26 PM] _leek#0000
which is insane for a drink with usually 70+% abv


[06/04/2023 5:27 PM] _leek#0000
yeah, mostly


[06/04/2023 5:27 PM] Krilalaris#7579
iirc annisette was banned in,the us for a bit


[06/04/2023 5:27 PM] Krilalaris#7579
wait no, absinthe


[06/04/2023 5:27 PM] Krilalaris#7579
"The Absinthe ban was based on a belief that the green liquid inside the bottle was hallucinogenic"


[06/04/2023 5:27 PM] _leek#0000
real wormwood has been banned in absinthe production here for while


[06/04/2023 5:27 PM] _leek#0000
because its a hallucinogenic


[06/04/2023 5:28 PM] _leek#0000
not just a belief


[06/04/2023 5:28 PM] Mossman#5168
Krilaris do you think I'm capable of psychological warfare


[06/04/2023 5:28 PM] Krilalaris#7579
"Wormwood contains a psychoactive compound called thujone that's long been linked to its purported hallucinogenic properties"


[06/04/2023 5:28 PM] Krilalaris#7579

[06/04/2023 5:28 PM] Mossman#5168

[06/04/2023 5:43 PM] the pancake man#6772
Nah I'm cool with leek. Besides if we steal leeks stuff then he'll have to buy more and then there'll be less stuff for his birds that I like.


[06/04/2023 5:43 PM] Mossman#5168
Hmm


[06/04/2023 5:44 PM] Mossman#5168
Are you helping in the defence?


[06/04/2023 5:44 PM] _leek#0000
sometimes I buy doubles of stuff so the budgies can have one to destroy


[06/04/2023 5:44 PM] Mossman#5168
Hmn


[06/04/2023 5:44 PM] _leek#0000
this ain't no joke


[06/04/2023 5:44 PM] the pancake man#6772
Yeah but I'm only defending the birds from any harm the rest is fair game as far as I'm concerned


[06/04/2023 5:45 PM] the pancake man#6772
I belive that one hundred percent

Kril do you want to help the invasion


[06/04/2023 5:47 PM] _leek#0000
I name my birds after whatever personality traits they exhibit and regardless of gender


[06/04/2023 5:47 PM] the pancake man#6772
Did Havelock kidnap the heiress to the throne of Dunwall or something


[06/04/2023 5:47 PM] _leek#0000
and her namesake, Havelock Vetinari (from the Terry Pratchett novels) is a relentless narcicisst


[06/04/2023 5:47 PM] the pancake man#6772
Oh that havelock


[06/04/2023 5:47 PM] _leek#0000

[06/04/2023 5:47 PM] Krilalaris#7579

[06/04/2023 5:48 PM] Krilalaris#7579

[06/04/2023 5:49 PM] Mossman#5168
Based, you can pick off the enemy lines then


[06/04/2023 5:49 PM] the pancake man#6772
I make bows sometimes. They're never good tho bc I can't get a better drawknife


[06/04/2023 5:49 PM] Mossman#5168

[06/04/2023 5:49 PM] _leek#0000

[06/04/2023 5:51 PM] Krilalaris#7579
my chicks like being petted


[06/04/2023 5:52 PM] Krilalaris#7579
the beeg rooster used to like pets and being held but then he hit puberty and became a beast of pure rage


[06/04/2023 5:52 PM] _leek#0000
no one goes near my little cripples without my consent


[06/04/2023 5:52 PM] Mossman#5168
No thanks


[06/04/2023 5:52 PM] _leek#0000

I'm in the mood to fight a dragon


[06/04/2023 5:57 PM] _leek#0000
you'd lose to a rabbit


[06/04/2023 5:57 PM] Mossman#5168
Only if it's that one off Monty python


[06/04/2023 5:57 PM] _leek#0000
wasn't specifically thinking of it but yeah, probably


[06/04/2023 5:57 PM] Lixius#9696
It‚Äôs that one off Monty Python


[06/04/2023 5:58 PM] _leek#0000
but so would all of us


[06/04/2023 5:58 PM] Lixius#9696
Probably


[06/04/2023 5:58 PM] Mossman#5168
That one looked tougher than a dragon


[06/04/2023 5:59 PM] Mossman#5168

thats just superb uffl eek

aka my actual physique


[06/04/2023 6:01 PM] Mossman#5168
Will that be helpful with the quest


[06/04/2023 6:02 PM] _leek#0000
if you need brawns and brains yea


[06/04/2023 6:02 PM] Mossman#5168
Why would we need brains


[06/04/2023 6:02 PM] Mossman#5168
We have an effective tactic already


[06/04/2023 6:03 PM] _leek#0000
well someone needs to have brains


[06/04/2023 6:03 PM] Mossman#5168
We just need to charge all at once


[06/04/2023 6:03 PM] _leek#0000
and, by all accounts, its not gonna be you


[06/04/2023 6:03 PM] Mossman#5168
What


[06/04/2023 6:04 PM] _leek#0000
you didn't get the latin earlier so I will not repeat


[06/04/2023 6:04 PM] Mossman#5168
I don't understand latin


[06/04/2023 6:04 PM] Mossman#5168
I have tactics though


[06/04/2023 6:05 PM] _leek#0000
sure sure :hmm:


[06/04/2023 6:05 PM] Mossman#5168
If charging all at once doesn't work then we either besiege them or dig a trench


[06/04/2023 6:06 PM] Mossman#5168
Then we all stand up and walk slowly in a line at them


[06/04/2023 6:07 PM] Mossman#5168
It's especially useful against machine gun emplacements


[06/04/2023 6:09 PM] _leek#0000
useful to die, maybe


[06/04/2023 6:13 PM] Mossman#5168
Nope, it scares them because it shows we don't fear them


[06/04/2023 6:13 PM] Mossman#5168
It especially helps if we stop all our shelling a set amount of time before and announce when we start

It‚Äôs a liquid


[06/05/2023 7:39 AM] Mask-san#5977

precisely :hmm:

So just once is the answer


[06/05/2023 7:42 AM] sirsen#7894
it'd taste like red bull when you breathe


[06/05/2023 7:42 AM] Mask-san#5977
More like copper


[06/05/2023 7:42 AM] sirsen#7894

Hi. Do you go outside?


[06/05/2023 10:47 AM] Mossman#5168
yeah i do


[06/05/2023 10:47 AM] Cheeze#7962
Unless they are deformed


[06/05/2023 10:47 AM] Mossman#5168
why


[06/05/2023 10:48 AM] Mossman#5168
literally just use a sling


[06/05/2023 10:48 AM] Mossman#5168
ammo is free (rocks)


[06/05/2023 10:49 AM] Mossman#5168
and you can also make them free by foraging fibre to make the sling


[06/05/2023 10:49 AM] Cheeze#7962
That is a good thing indeed. I thought you were to grind away your life to gain useless levels on a discord server looking at your roles


[06/05/2023 10:49 AM] Mossman#5168
no ive just been here fro over 3 years

[06/05/2023 10:50 AM] Mossman#5168

[06/05/2023 10:50 AM] Cheeze#7962
Sorry, how looooooong he was here?


[06/05/2023 10:51 AM] Krilalaris#7579

[06/05/2023 10:51 AM] Cheeze#7962
Wich type?


[06/05/2023 10:51 AM] Krilalaris#7579
bro is just primitive technology


[06/05/2023 10:51 AM] Mossman#5168
plate armour


[06/05/2023 10:51 AM] Mossman#5168
nah, im not that good


[06/05/2023 10:51 AM] Mossman#5168
im alright with a sling though


[06/05/2023 10:51 AM] Krilalaris#7579
i just get really big rocks and throw them


[06/05/2023 10:52 AM] Mossman#5168
getting decent with one isnt difficult, getting good with one is really difficult


[06/05/2023 10:52 AM] Cheeze#7962
It is rather a difficult challenge to forge plate armor that would last long


[06/05/2023 10:52 AM] Mossman#5168
what


[06/05/2023 10:52 AM] Mossman#5168
no, plate armour not plot armour


[06/05/2023 10:52 AM] Krilalaris#7579
:Aqua_GalaxyBrain:


[06/05/2023 10:53 AM] Cheeze#7962
Typo


[06/05/2023 10:53 AM] Mossman#5168
the main problem with forging plate armour is making the articultaion


[06/05/2023 10:54 AM] Krilalaris#7579
make chain mail


[06/05/2023 10:54 AM] Mossman#5168
ive tried before


[06/05/2023 10:54 AM] Mossman#5168
im awful at it


[06/05/2023 10:55 AM] Krilalaris#7579
my friend made it by just connecting a bunch of small key ringd


[06/05/2023 10:55 AM] Mossman#5168
im still awful at it


[06/05/2023 10:56 AM] Krilalaris#7579
its hella tedious so


[06/05/2023 10:56 AM] Krilalaris#7579
adhd brain


[06/05/2023 10:56 AM] Mossman#5168
nah, dyspraxia for me


[06/05/2023 10:56 AM] Mossman#5168
forging sheet metal with a big hammer works for me


[06/05/2023 10:57 AM] Krilalaris#7579
i see


[06/05/2023 10:59 AM] Luci#8827

[06/05/2023 11:05 AM] Luci#8827
How did it feel going down your gullet


[06/05/2023 11:06 AM] Krilalaris#7579

[06/05/2023 11:06 AM] Luci#8827
Unable to come back out


[06/05/2023 11:06 AM] Mossman#5168
luci you should forge armour


[06/05/2023 11:06 AM] Mr. specimen#9840
Tastes raw, bitter


[06/05/2023 11:06 AM] Luci#8827
Idk about that


[06/05/2023 11:06 AM] Luci#8827
I should


[06/05/2023 11:06 AM] Mossman#5168
then you should fight me


[06/05/2023 11:06 AM] Mr. specimen#9840
I feel like my brain smells it


[06/05/2023 11:06 AM] Mossman#5168
or fight alongside me


[06/05/2023 11:06 AM] Luci#8827
I could fight you without armor


[06/05/2023 11:06 AM] Luci#8827
I‚Äôm fighting against your guild


[06/05/2023 11:06 AM] Luci#8827
We can partner up later


[06/05/2023 11:06 AM] Mossman#5168
i dont have a guild


[06/05/2023 11:07 AM] Luci#8827
To fight someone else like leek


[06/05/2023 11:07 AM] Luci#8827

Tactics for what


[06/05/2023 11:08 AM] Luci#8827
Idk


[06/05/2023 11:08 AM] Luci#8827

[06/05/2023 11:09 AM] Mr. specimen#9840

[06/05/2023 11:10 AM] Luci#8827
Nice pfp @optimusarun


[06/05/2023 11:10 AM] Mossman#5168
yay, what tactics are we gonna use


[06/05/2023 11:10 AM] Mossman#5168
shield wall?


[06/05/2023 11:10 AM] Mossman#5168
pike formation?


[06/05/2023 11:11 AM] Mossman#5168
boars head formation?


[06/05/2023 11:11 AM] Mossman#5168
wedge?


[06/05/2023 11:11 AM] Luci#8827
None of those


[06/05/2023 11:11 AM] Mossman#5168
what


[06/05/2023 11:11 AM] Luci#8827
We‚Äôre gonna have 3/4 of our army attack from the front


[06/05/2023 11:12 AM] Luci#8827
And then 1/8th of the army be spies


[06/05/2023 11:12 AM] Luci#8827
And the other 1/8th will attack from the back


[06/05/2023 11:13 AM] Wonder#8192
Banns


[06/05/2023 11:13 AM] Luci#8827
So they‚Äôll be getting attached head on, from the back, and by their own men


[06/05/2023 11:13 AM] Wonder#8192
Bananas


[06/05/2023 11:13 AM] Wonder#8192
I ate food


[06/05/2023 11:13 AM] Luci#8827
I could kill someone with a banana


[06/05/2023 11:13 AM] Wonder#8192
And now my stomach and head hurt


[06/05/2023 11:13 AM] Luci#8827
What kind of food


[06/05/2023 11:13 AM] Wonder#8192
Meat


[06/05/2023 11:13 AM] Mossman#5168
which bit will i be in


[06/05/2023 11:13 AM] Wonder#8192
I think I under cooked it


[06/05/2023 11:13 AM] Luci#8827
Head on


[06/05/2023 11:13 AM] Mossman#5168
yay!


[06/05/2023 11:14 AM] Luci#8827
You‚Äôre not the spy type


[06/05/2023 11:14 AM] Wonder#8192
That‚Äôs the first time that‚Äôs ever happened


[06/05/2023 11:14 AM] Mossman#5168
i cant do cavalry because i cant ride a horse


[06/05/2023 11:14 AM] Luci#8827
Plus you‚Äôd feel bad about attacking from behind


[06/05/2023 11:14 AM] Luci#8827
Sure


[06/05/2023 11:14 AM] Luci#8827
How‚Äôd you undercook


[06/05/2023 11:14 AM] Mossman#5168
yeah


[06/05/2023 11:14 AM] Wonder#8192
I wouldn‚Äôt~


[06/05/2023 11:14 AM] Luci#8827
Was it like blue rare


[06/05/2023 11:14 AM] Luci#8827
Oh


[06/05/2023 11:14 AM] Wonder#8192
Well


[06/05/2023 11:14 AM] Mossman#5168
exactly


[06/05/2023 11:14 AM] Wonder#8192
I wasn‚Äôt the one cooking it necessarily


[06/05/2023 11:15 AM] Luci#8827
Ah


[06/05/2023 11:15 AM] Luci#8827
I‚Äôm more of a spy type


[06/05/2023 11:15 AM] Mossman#5168
i can lead a wedge formation and break enemy lines


[06/05/2023 11:15 AM] Luci#8827
Or assistant to the general ~~manager~~


[06/05/2023 11:15 AM] Luci#8827
Sure


[06/05/2023 11:15 AM] Luci#8827
I‚Äôd need at least 3 leaders


[06/05/2023 11:15 AM] Wonder#8192
I‚Äôll just seduce the enemy leader


[06/05/2023 11:15 AM] Luci#8827
Different formations that can be used together


[06/05/2023 11:15 AM] Wonder#8192
Because magic


[06/05/2023 11:15 AM] Luci#8827
But can still break the enemy lines


[06/05/2023 11:16 AM] Luci#8827
Plus I need a few groups that will do whatever they want


[06/05/2023 11:16 AM] Luci#8827
To add a bit of chaos


[06/05/2023 11:16 AM] Luci#8827
Magic is cool


[06/05/2023 11:16 AM] Wonder#8192
Yar


[06/05/2023 11:17 AM] Mossman#5168
can i lead head on attacks


[06/05/2023 11:17 AM] Luci#8827
Sure


[06/05/2023 11:18 AM] Luci#8827
I was gonna say you could be in the center


[06/05/2023 11:18 AM] Mossman#5168
what


[06/05/2023 11:18 AM] Luci#8827
But I think having you on the left side would be more beneficial


[06/05/2023 11:18 AM] Luci#8827
Because they‚Äôll most likely having a strong head on formation in the center and right


[06/05/2023 11:18 AM] Luci#8827
So it‚Äôs better to use more unorthodox formations against those pushes


[06/05/2023 11:19 AM] Mossman#5168
hmm


[06/05/2023 11:19 AM] Mossman#5168
i refuse to stay on the outer flank though


[06/05/2023 11:19 AM] Mossman#5168
i think we should use a cavalry wedge to open up their lines


[06/05/2023 11:19 AM] Luci#8827
Too risky


[06/05/2023 11:19 AM] Mossman#5168
and then do an infantry charge into their lines


[06/05/2023 11:20 AM] Luci#8827
Infantry charge first


[06/05/2023 11:20 AM] Wonder#8192
We have a tank


[06/05/2023 11:20 AM] Mossman#5168
hmm


[06/05/2023 11:20 AM] Wonder#8192
Don‚Äôt forgor


[06/05/2023 11:20 AM] Luci#8827
Tank works


[06/05/2023 11:20 AM] Mossman#5168
i have plate armour


[06/05/2023 11:20 AM] Mossman#5168
are we gonna do a pike formation too to prevent charges


[06/05/2023 11:20 AM] Krilalaris#7579
i actually used to know a girl who owned a working sherman


[06/05/2023 11:20 AM] Luci#8827
Hm


[06/05/2023 11:20 AM] Luci#8827
Not sure


[06/05/2023 11:20 AM] Luci#8827
You can decide that


[06/05/2023 11:21 AM] Luci#8827
Ofc


[06/05/2023 11:21 AM] Wonder#8192
Dam


[06/05/2023 11:21 AM] Luci#8827
Need me a girl like that


[06/05/2023 11:21 AM] dyl#8086

[06/05/2023 11:21 AM] Luci#8827

[06/05/2023 11:22 AM] Mossman#5168

[06/05/2023 11:22 AM] Luci#8827
Sure


[06/05/2023 11:22 AM] Luci#8827

[06/05/2023 11:22 AM] Luci#8827
You almost got yourself propagated by the us military


[06/05/2023 11:22 AM] Luci#8827
So why not our army


[06/05/2023 11:23 AM] dyl#8086
because


[06/05/2023 11:23 AM] Mossman#5168
isnt propogation what you do with seeds


[06/05/2023 11:23 AM] dyl#8086
there‚Äôs two definitions


[06/05/2023 11:23 AM] dyl#8086
they should do that less


[06/05/2023 11:23 AM] dyl#8086
words are infinite


[06/05/2023 11:23 AM] dyl#8086
just give them one direct meaning


[06/05/2023 11:23 AM] dyl#8086

[06/05/2023 11:24 AM] Mossman#5168

[06/05/2023 11:25 AM] Luci#8827
But then how are elementary schoolers supposed to make the gay means happy jokes


[06/05/2023 11:25 AM] Mossman#5168
we need to start marching


[06/05/2023 11:28 AM] Luci#8827
Marching is for bands


[06/05/2023 11:41 AM] Wonder#8192
Let‚Äôs get the tank ready


[06/05/2023 11:41 AM] Wonder#8192
Give it


[06/05/2023 11:41 AM] Wonder#8192
What do tanks need?


[06/05/2023 11:41 AM] Wonder#8192
Diesel


[06/05/2023 11:41 AM] Wonder#8192

Reminder that cuddling kittens is literally good for your health, lowers your risk of heart disease because it calms you down.

Totally valid to be single. I've been questioning if I'm aromantic, because I kinda feel like I'm not attracted to anything...

Life is a pain worth going through.


[06/05/2023 3:20 PM] Insecticidenmind#7076
Because you can use it to make others lives less painful, right?


[06/05/2023 3:20 PM] sirsen#7894
but then if it's like....did that even happen, am i just crazy? wtf is this shit


[06/05/2023 3:20 PM] sirsen#7894
i guess the amount of drugs and alcohol involved in my 20s kinda ruined me tbh


[06/05/2023 3:21 PM] sirsen#7894
but then what if you make it worse by accident?


[06/05/2023 3:21 PM] Insecticidenmind#7076
When everyone works together to make it hurt less instead of boiling in that pain, everything can get better. No matter how high the hell is, theres things you can do that guarantee happiness for others.

I consider myself a positive pessimist. I see the world only for its faults, evils, cruelties, when I look at any object all I can think of is the pain getting it into my hand caused. But I use that pessimism to say "Well this is bad, but I can do something about it"


[06/05/2023 3:27 PM] Insecticidenmind#7076
I feel bad about drinking from water bottles sometimes because I know they would be better in the hands of people in disaster areas who don't have any clean water.

as a mechanic i can relate, fixing things is satisfying

It's perfectly fine to just donate to a cancer research fund instead of trying to find a cure yourself, but if you think you can then do it.


[06/05/2023 3:31 PM] sirsen#7894
well cant really do either rn tbh, im kinda reliant on charities for food tbh


[06/05/2023 3:32 PM] sirsen#7894
but i'd like too, just can't


[06/05/2023 3:33 PM] Insecticidenmind#7076
It's also okay to be the one in need.


[06/05/2023 3:33 PM] sirsen#7894
took me a while to get over tha shame tbh


[06/05/2023 3:35 PM] sirsen#7894
but I've done wayyyy more shameful shit than being poor and hungry :kekw:


[06/05/2023 3:37 PM] sirsen#7894
mostly when i did have money, that was when i was most shameful


[06/05/2023 3:37 PM] Insecticidenmind#7076
Too many people view those in need as below them, but I've really started to see all people as equally valid. Have you ever seen a burn victim with not much left of their face from the eyes down? I've been in a lot of hospitals and it was scary to imagine someone who is just as human as you go through something you can't imagine yourself going through, but once you talk to people in those situations you realize just how universal pain is. The best we can do is try to help eachother feel less pain.


[06/05/2023 3:38 PM] sirsen#7894
i did try help charities when i could, but i  was a piece of shit


[06/05/2023 3:39 PM] Insecticidenmind#7076
I'm sure you weren't, helping charities is an honorable thing.

[06/05/2023 3:42 PM] Insecticidenmind#7076
That's a response to pain a lot of people have. Run to whatever makes you comfortable, abandoning moderation. It's not healthy, but it's understandable. And it's good you could get past that.


[06/05/2023 3:42 PM] sirsen#7894
and im still abit bipolar so i am still a burden to anyone that is stupid enough to have me around


[06/05/2023 3:43 PM] sirsen#7894
unfortunate, but that's the reality of mental problems


[06/05/2023 3:43 PM] Insecticidenmind#7076
Hey, no don't say that. It's okay to be bipolar, my mother is bipolar actually. It's not stupid to have you around, you seem like a perfectly good person.

I'm on the autism spectrum which can make me a bit of a pain to people who don't understand, I get feeling like a burden when your brain's just different.


[06/05/2023 3:46 PM] Insecticidenmind#7076
But that's just a feeling. Those are people who don't understand how you work.


[06/05/2023 3:47 PM] sirsen#7894
but sometimes conditions like that cause swings that make the person not themselves, and booze and weed propably doesn't help, apparantly i have aspergers so i understand the misconceptions, my brain is just different, like i was mentioning earlier with the seizures,like physically different,but not in a good way


[06/05/2023 3:48 PM] Insecticidenmind#7076
Oh, aspergers isn't uh. Really a term people use anymore. It's just called autism now. Aspergers was named after a nazi so they got rid of it.


[06/05/2023 3:49 PM] sirsen#7894
yeah it's just specteral disorder now right?


[06/05/2023 3:50 PM] Insecticidenmind#7076
I used to use aspergers but I realized that was some internalized ableism because I didn't want to be called autistic.


[06/05/2023 3:51 PM] Insecticidenmind#7076
That's a version of it but more commonly called ASD.


[06/05/2023 3:52 PM] Insecticidenmind#7076
Spectrum disorder is a class of disorders that include autism, anxiety, ptsd, ocd, schizophrenia and more.


[06/05/2023 3:53 PM] Insecticidenmind#7076
Any mental disorder with varying degrees.

[06/06/2023 11:39 PM] the pancake man#6772
I swear I've searched for it before. First time I'm seeing it on here. Very poggers if you ask me.

[06/06/2023 11:39 PM] the pancake man#6772
Shame they took Pan's Labyrinth


[06/06/2023 11:39 PM] Luci#8827

[06/06/2023 11:39 PM] the pancake man#6772
Must've been taken off at some point


[06/06/2023 11:40 PM] Luci#8827

[06/06/2023 11:40 PM] Luci#8827
It was fairly recent


[06/06/2023 11:42 PM] the pancake man#6772

You should have one


[06/07/2023 6:15 AM] ‚ãÜLynx‚ãÜ#4926
Make one maybe


[06/07/2023 6:16 AM] ‚ãÜLynx‚ãÜ#4926
Since you in a calorie deficit maybe you could make small mini ones


[06/07/2023 6:18 AM] Approacher#3359
Cant, even if I wanted to


[06/07/2023 6:18 AM] r a i n#0903
one doesnt hurt


[06/07/2023 6:18 AM] Approacher#3359
Cuz I'm at uni and bakery is at home (70+ km away from me)


[06/07/2023 6:18 AM] ‚ãÜLynx‚ãÜ#4926
Damn


[06/07/2023 6:19 AM] r a i n#0903
one every week hurts

road trip!!


[06/07/2023 6:19 AM] ‚ãÜLynx‚ãÜ#4926
Rent out a whole bakery to make 1 mini cheesecake


[06/07/2023 6:20 AM] ‚ãÜLynx‚ãÜ#4926
Or pay the bakers to make one


[06/07/2023 6:20 AM] r a i n#0903
if you drive at 180kmh avg, you could be there in like 24 mins


[06/07/2023 6:20 AM] r a i n#0903
or 140 if ur a bit scared, get there in 30 mins


[06/07/2023 6:22 AM] ‚ãÜLynx‚ãÜ#4926
It would take less time in a helicopter


[06/07/2023 6:22 AM] ‚ãÜLynx‚ãÜ#4926

is it worse to kill a jew or a white man


[06/07/2023 7:07 AM] r a i n#0903
have u seen the fuel prices these days?


[06/07/2023 7:07 AM] r a i n#0903
im pretty sure theyre both just as bad


[06/07/2023 7:09 AM] Ladegarade#1038
in this economy?! why not just flap your hands and fly smh


[06/07/2023 7:09 AM] Shiba#2884
nah cus what if i get done with a race crime


[06/07/2023 7:10 AM] ‚ãÜLynx‚ãÜ#4926
Expensive but takes less than 25 mins (I think) and apparently helicopters have around 2-3 hrs of flying before they need to refuel


[06/07/2023 7:11 AM] ‚ãÜLynx‚ãÜ#4926
That would be fun


[06/07/2023 7:12 AM] r a i n#0903
what if the white man was a jew


[06/07/2023 7:12 AM] Shiba#2884
true how do i check


[06/07/2023 7:12 AM] r a i n#0903
well think about this, the helicopter will top out at like 160kmh usually


[06/07/2023 7:13 AM] r a i n#0903
and the car has a range of like 700km before refuel


[06/07/2023 7:13 AM] r a i n#0903
sooo u decide whats more convienient ig


[06/07/2023 7:13 AM] r a i n#0903
ask


[06/07/2023 7:13 AM] Ladegarade#1038
the only problem is you need to flap your hands 1000times per second, but I think robotics can help there.


[06/07/2023 7:13 AM] r a i n#0903
just use time dilation and length contraction


[06/07/2023 7:13 AM] r a i n#0903
use the LHC and accelerate yourself to the speed of light


[06/07/2023 7:14 AM] r a i n#0903
and then you can get there in under 1 second


[06/07/2023 7:14 AM] ‚ãÜLynx‚ãÜ#4926
Idk Im not having to travel for cheesecake


[06/07/2023 7:14 AM] r a i n#0903
is there no shops near you?


[06/07/2023 7:14 AM] ‚ãÜLynx‚ãÜ#4926
Easy peasy


[06/07/2023 7:15 AM] ‚ãÜLynx‚ãÜ#4926
There is, but the issue of getting somewhere quickly was not my cheesecake problem


[06/07/2023 7:16 AM] r a i n#0903
go to woolies


[06/07/2023 7:16 AM] r a i n#0903
get some cheese


[06/07/2023 7:16 AM] r a i n#0903
grab ur homie's ass


[06/07/2023 7:16 AM] r a i n#0903
and then put it together


[06/07/2023 7:16 AM] r a i n#0903
eat


[06/07/2023 7:16 AM] r a i n#0903
ass = cake right?


[06/07/2023 7:16 AM] r a i n#0903
cheese + ass = cheesecake


[06/07/2023 7:17 AM] r a i n#0903

the jets? or the needles?


[06/07/2023 1:50 PM] sirsen#7894
like eat the jets to clean them? cause then they'd be clogged with poo


[06/07/2023 1:50 PM] Mossman#5168
Eat a dodgy vindaloo


[06/07/2023 1:51 PM] sirsen#7894
your stomach acid would probably clean any old fuel out of them tho


[06/07/2023 1:51 PM] sirsen#7894
and poo would be easier to clean than crusty dried old petrol


[06/07/2023 1:52 PM] Mossman#5168
Exactly


[06/07/2023 1:52 PM] sirsen#7894
just abit more gross, so I'll stick with the needle and scraping the crud out this time

interesting idea, but i think it'd be easier to  mail paper than chain, chains quite heavy

## Episode I
## The Phantom Menace
### Turmoil has engulfed the galactic republic. The taxation of trade routes to outlying star systems is in dispute.
## Hoping to resolve the matter with a blockade of deadly battleships, the greedy Trade Federation has stopped all shipping to the small planet of Naboo.
# While the congress of the Republic endlessly debates this alarming chain of events, the Supreme Chancellor has secretly dispatched two Jedi Knights, the guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy, to settle the conflict...

Forget to eat and have a random day where you do a lot of exercise


[06/08/2023 2:12 AM] Luci#8827
But not actual gym exercise


[06/08/2023 2:13 AM] Luci#8827
More like walking a few miles because you thought it‚Äôd be a good idea


[06/08/2023 2:13 AM] Lolivana#8493
Wearing tight jeans in this temperature was a mistake


[06/08/2023 2:13 AM] Luci#8827
Sweat the weight off


[06/08/2023 2:13 AM] Luci#8827
What‚Äôs the temp there


[06/08/2023 2:13 AM] Lolivana#8493

[06/08/2023 2:14 AM] Luci#8827

[06/08/2023 2:14 AM] Wonder#8192
Sit in the wet pavement and metamorphosis


[06/08/2023 2:14 AM] Lolivana#8493
Was looking for ice cream but I'm not particularly interested in any of the flavours


[06/08/2023 2:14 AM] Luci#8827
What flavors did they have


[06/08/2023 2:15 AM] Lolivana#8493
The standard


[06/08/2023 2:15 AM] Lolivana#8493
I wanted sorbet


[06/08/2023 2:15 AM] Luci#8827

[06/08/2023 2:16 AM] Luci#8827

[06/08/2023 2:16 AM] Luci#8827

[06/08/2023 2:16 AM] Luci#8827
Damn

[06/08/2023 2:17 AM] Luci#8827
Also really light


[06/08/2023 2:17 AM] Lolivana#8493
My other friend is short af and weighs 48


[06/08/2023 2:17 AM] Luci#8827
Woah


[06/08/2023 2:17 AM] Lolivana#8493
But he can also practically run on his hands so whatever


[06/08/2023 2:17 AM] Luci#8827
What does that mean


[06/08/2023 2:18 AM] Lolivana#8493
Little ninja man


[06/08/2023 2:18 AM] Lolivana#8493
Small, flexible and runs real fast


[06/08/2023 2:18 AM] Luci#8827
Just like me fr


[06/08/2023 2:18 AM] Lolivana#8493
Very strong for a small guy


[06/08/2023 2:18 AM] Luci#8827
You should have them bench you


[06/08/2023 2:19 AM] Luci#8827
Or princess carry you


[06/08/2023 2:19 AM] Lolivana#8493
I blanked out for a solid second and forgot you were Luci


[06/08/2023 2:19 AM] Luci#8827
I did too


[06/08/2023 2:19 AM] Luci#8827

[06/08/2023 2:19 AM] Lolivana#8493
10 days


[06/08/2023 2:19 AM] Luci#8827
Damn


[06/08/2023 2:19 AM] Lolivana#8493
Including today


[06/08/2023 2:20 AM] Luci#8827
Yeah 10 days seems like a good amount of time


[06/08/2023 2:20 AM] Luci#8827
You‚Äôre either gonna end up like everyone else and want to live there


[06/08/2023 2:20 AM] Lolivana#8493
Should I get cold tea


[06/08/2023 2:20 AM] Luci#8827
Or you‚Äôre gonna think it‚Äôs cool and then never go back


[06/08/2023 2:20 AM] Luci#8827
Yes


[06/08/2023 2:20 AM] Lolivana#8493
Or should I walk another lap of this place


[06/08/2023 2:20 AM] Luci#8827
Lap


[06/08/2023 2:20 AM] Luci#8827
Lap


[06/08/2023 2:20 AM] Luci#8827
Lap


[06/08/2023 2:20 AM] Lolivana#8493
Ok


[06/08/2023 2:21 AM] Luci#8827
Should I sleep


[06/08/2023 2:21 AM] Luci#8827
Or stay awake for a bit


[06/08/2023 2:21 AM] Lolivana#8493
What's the time


[06/08/2023 2:21 AM] Luci#8827

[06/08/2023 2:21 AM] Lolivana#8493
Also why the fuck are they making another transformers movie


[06/08/2023 2:22 AM] Luci#8827
I have no idea


[06/08/2023 2:22 AM] Lolivana#8493
Do u have to wake up early tmr


[06/08/2023 2:22 AM] Luci#8827
It‚Äôs transformers beasts


[06/08/2023 2:22 AM] Luci#8827
No


[06/08/2023 2:22 AM] Lolivana#8493
Then stay up a bit more


[06/08/2023 2:22 AM] Luci#8827
I‚Äôm probably gonna be a degen tomorrow


[06/08/2023 2:22 AM] Luci#8827
And stay inside all day


[06/08/2023 2:22 AM] Lolivana#8493
If I stay inside all day I feel all jittery until I go outside


[06/08/2023 2:23 AM] Luci#8827
What touching grass does to a person

[06/08/2023 2:23 AM] Luci#8827
When I stay inside all day, I usually run out of things to do


[06/08/2023 2:23 AM] Luci#8827
So I sleep more


[06/08/2023 2:23 AM] Lolivana#8493
I went there yesterday?


[06/08/2023 2:23 AM] Lolivana#8493
I think


[06/08/2023 2:23 AM] Lolivana#8493
Wait no the day before that


[06/08/2023 2:23 AM] Luci#8827
Which results in me being able to stay awake longer when I find something interesting to do


[06/08/2023 2:23 AM] Luci#8827
Pretty


[06/08/2023 2:23 AM] Lolivana#8493
Yesterday I hit jim


[06/08/2023 2:24 AM] Luci#8827

[06/08/2023 2:24 AM] Lolivana#8493
Mah legs still hurt


[06/08/2023 2:24 AM] Lolivana#8493
Cannot believe this


[06/08/2023 2:25 AM] Luci#8827
This was today


[06/08/2023 2:25 AM] Luci#8827
Leg days are rough


[06/08/2023 2:26 AM] Lolivana#8493
Why do u have the Hollywood Mexico filter on


[06/08/2023 2:26 AM] Luci#8827
Breaking bad


[06/08/2023 2:26 AM] Lolivana#8493
Gay meth


[06/08/2023 2:26 AM] Luci#8827
There was a fire in Canada and now everything is yellow


[06/08/2023 2:27 AM] Lolivana#8493
I remember waking up like 4 days ago at 5am and the sky was mango yellow


[06/08/2023 2:27 AM] Luci#8827
That sounds nice


[06/08/2023 2:27 AM] Lolivana#8493
Isn't Canada cold


[06/08/2023 2:27 AM] Lolivana#8493
Why fire


[06/08/2023 2:27 AM] Luci#8827
Yeah


[06/08/2023 2:27 AM] Luci#8827
Probably a gender reveal party


[06/08/2023 2:27 AM] Luci#8827
Gender stronger than cold I guess


[06/08/2023 2:27 AM] Lolivana#8493
:AstelZoom:


[06/08/2023 2:27 AM] Lolivana#8493
Pride month Vs temperature


[06/08/2023 2:27 AM] Luci#8827
Exactly


[06/08/2023 2:28 AM] Luci#8827
I almost took my shirt off


[06/08/2023 2:28 AM] Luci#8827
And that caused half of Canada to combust


[06/08/2023 2:28 AM] Luci#8827
My bad


[06/08/2023 2:28 AM] Lolivana#8493

[06/08/2023 2:28 AM] Lolivana#8493
I just want a smooth belly :AiriThumbUp:


[06/08/2023 2:28 AM] Luci#8827

[06/08/2023 2:32 AM] Lolivana#8493
Imagine having worse air quality than a Chinese city


[06/08/2023 2:32 AM] Luci#8827
Wait what the hell

Stay safe


[06/08/2023 2:34 AM] Luci#8827
Masks barely doing anything


[06/08/2023 2:34 AM] Luci#8827
They help


[06/08/2023 2:34 AM] Lolivana#8493
Become an aquatic creature


[06/08/2023 2:34 AM] Luci#8827
But the smoke still gets through


[06/08/2023 2:34 AM] Luci#8827
It‚Äôs really strong


[06/08/2023 2:35 AM] dyl#8086

[06/08/2023 2:36 AM] Luci#8827
I feel bad for the pets


[06/08/2023 2:36 AM] Luci#8827
I love those fake Gucci belts


[06/08/2023 2:36 AM] Luci#8827
Buying fake Gucci is a good decision


[06/08/2023 2:36 AM] Luci#8827
I wonder if the air is gonna be worse or better tomorrow


[06/08/2023 2:37 AM] dyl#8086

[06/08/2023 2:38 AM] Luci#8827
Maybe not for your guys


[06/08/2023 2:38 AM] Luci#8827
But probably for us


[06/08/2023 2:38 AM] dyl#8086

[06/08/2023 2:38 AM] Luci#8827
Not at all


[06/08/2023 2:38 AM] dyl#8086

[06/08/2023 2:38 AM] Lolivana#8493
Why are there two new Yorks


[06/08/2023 2:38 AM] Luci#8827

Why not


[06/08/2023 2:38 AM] dyl#8086

[06/08/2023 2:40 AM] Luci#8827
But as a whole he is not hot


[06/08/2023 2:41 AM] Lolivana#8493
When I die I want it to be between them thighs


[06/08/2023 2:41 AM] Luci#8827

[06/08/2023 2:41 AM] Luci#8827
Crushed like the watermelon

I wanna try crushing a watermelon between my thighs


[06/08/2023 2:41 AM] Lolivana#8493
I could not


[06/08/2023 2:41 AM] Luci#8827
Apparently with the machine I did like 300 pounds


[06/08/2023 2:41 AM] Luci#8827
So I might be able to


[06/08/2023 2:42 AM] Lolivana#8493
Maybe my friend could tho she can squat 80 kilos


[06/08/2023 2:42 AM] Luci#8827
Unless the machine is using fake weights which is very possible


[06/08/2023 2:42 AM] Wonder#8192
I can


[06/08/2023 2:42 AM] Luci#8827
Damn


[06/08/2023 2:42 AM] Luci#8827
Strong legs


[06/08/2023 2:42 AM] Lolivana#8493
300 pounds is like more than twice my weight


[06/08/2023 2:42 AM] Lolivana#8493
Very impressive

[06/08/2023 2:44 AM] Luci#8827
Wait after you recovered?


[06/08/2023 2:44 AM] Lolivana#8493

[06/08/2023 2:45 AM] Luci#8827

Justafiable reason on punching him IMO


[06/08/2023 7:20 AM] sirsen#7894
it would have been very very justified trust me, the guy had just finished his rant about how woman are evil, he's known for trying to start fights by saying stupid shit on purpose, irl  troll


[06/08/2023 7:21 AM] sirsen#7894
but not fun or funny trolling, just being a dick


[06/08/2023 7:21 AM] sirsen#7894

[06/08/2023 12:31 PM] Wonder#8192
Freezing


[06/08/2023 12:31 PM] Luci#8827
Freezing does seem worse


[06/08/2023 12:31 PM] LArryboi#9585

[06/08/2023 12:31 PM] LArryboi#9585
You freeze and you go numb can't feel anything burning you feel it all


[06/08/2023 12:31 PM] Luci#8827
No you don‚Äôt


[06/08/2023 12:31 PM] Wonder#8192
You feel yourself become sluggish and your mind fog overtime


[06/08/2023 12:31 PM] Luci#8827
With burning, it burns your nerves off


[06/08/2023 12:31 PM] LArryboi#9585
Nah ppfff


[06/08/2023 12:31 PM] Luci#8827

[06/08/2023 12:32 PM] LArryboi#9585
When you got a ouchie on ya


[06/08/2023 12:32 PM] Luci#8827
With burning you‚Äôll be flailing


[06/08/2023 12:32 PM] Wonder#8192
You pull up your gloves to find your hands black


[06/08/2023 12:32 PM] Wonder#8192
And your feet feel numb


[06/08/2023 12:32 PM] Luci#8827
With freezing you‚Äôll start to compact


[06/08/2023 12:32 PM] LArryboi#9585
Did your mum ever tell you to "go grab the chuck of coal outa the fire"


[06/08/2023 12:32 PM] Luci#8827

Like if it rains


[06/08/2023 12:33 PM] Luci#8827
Who thinks of freezing to death and automatically thinks of water


[06/08/2023 12:33 PM] LArryboi#9585
Cold water?


[06/08/2023 12:33 PM] Wonder#8192

Yeah but most people wouldn‚Äôt think of cold water


[06/08/2023 12:34 PM] LArryboi#9585
In the artic you can only be in the water for a few minutes before freezing

Pizza Tower OST - The Death That I Deservioli (Lap 2)
Peppino dies in honorable combat to save his restaurant.

I do not own the music. Pizza tower composers are Mr. Sauceman, ClascyJitto(Frostix) and POST ELVIS.
Pizza tower belongs to Tour De Pizza.

Come on, just buy the soundtrack!! You know you want it!

I do not own the music. Pizza tower composers are Mr. Sauceman, ClascyJitto(Frostix) and POST ELVIS.
Pizza tower belongs to Tour De Pizza.

Come on, just buy the soundtrack!! You know you want it!

"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you‚Äôre watching this tape, I‚Äôm probably dead‚Äì murdered by my brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now, and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my fiftieth birthday, Hank came to me with a rather shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world, connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was astounded. I‚ÄìI always thought Hank was a very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time‚Äìsomething he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride-along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn‚Äôt want my family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head and, Hank had a partner named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn‚Äôt know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, of which Fring flatly refused to give it, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh, I guess‚Ä¶ I guess you call it a hit on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills, which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge. Working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me. And he gave me no option in that. I have often contemplated suicide, but I‚Äôm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened.

[04/11/2023 8:45 PM] Thememer_77#5107
Hank had risen in the reigns to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time to keep me in line, he took my children from me, for three months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done. Why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. And I was in hell. I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me. Or worse, hurt my family. All I could think to do was to make this video and hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is."

[04/14/2023 9:04 PM] Minejerik#2582

This districts security is a little poo poo garbage


[04/21/2023 2:22 PM] Minejerik#2582
Just a little


[04/21/2023 2:23 PM] Thememer_77#5107
ya you just some 14 year old fucking around think about what someone could do if they where trying to do some real damage


[04/21/2023 2:23 PM] Minejerik#2582
Yep


[04/21/2023 2:23 PM] Minejerik#2582

[04/21/2023 2:23 PM] Thememer_77#5107
hmm?


[04/21/2023 2:23 PM] Minejerik#2582
I may have just found the camera server


[04/21/2023 2:24 PM] Thememer_77#5107
Isn't it a closed conection?


[04/21/2023 2:24 PM] Minejerik#2582
nvm


[04/21/2023 2:24 PM] Minejerik#2582
I found the router


[04/21/2023 2:24 PM] Minejerik#2582
It has a very similar name to the camera company


[04/21/2023 2:24 PM] Minejerik#2582
Avigilon

For the goofy


[04/21/2023 2:34 PM] Minejerik#2582
Sadly


[04/21/2023 2:34 PM] Minejerik#2582
I had to stop the scan early


[04/21/2023 2:34 PM] Minejerik#2582
But I still saved over 2k IPs


[04/21/2023 2:35 PM] Thememer_77#5107
damn you should tell someone about the shity security system


[04/21/2023 2:35 PM] Minejerik#2582
I mean


[04/21/2023 2:35 PM] Minejerik#2582
I started this project for a challenge


[04/21/2023 2:35 PM] Minejerik#2582
Not a cake walk


[04/21/2023 2:35 PM] Minejerik#2582
So maybe


[04/21/2023 2:35 PM] Minejerik#2582

Senior year


[04/21/2023 2:37 PM] Minejerik#2582
I need more time@to collect data


[04/21/2023 2:37 PM] Minejerik#2582
also


[04/21/2023 2:38 PM] Minejerik#2582
if I do it now I would have to deal with the reprocussions


[04/21/2023 2:39 PM] Thememer_77#5107
yea Im just saying this sounds like a bunch of legal crap you could get your self into


[04/21/2023 2:39 PM] Minejerik#2582
Ik


[04/21/2023 2:39 PM] Minejerik#2582

[04/21/2023 2:39 PM] Minejerik#2582
I will email them from another email


[04/21/2023 2:39 PM] Minejerik#2582
After the prank


[04/21/2023 2:39 PM] Minejerik#2582
Telling them about how I did it


[04/21/2023 2:40 PM] Minejerik#2582
but I will stay anonymous


[04/21/2023 2:40 PM] Thememer_77#5107

[04/21/2023 2:41 PM] Thememer_77#5107

[04/21/2023 2:42 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
Make sure to use a vpn


[04/21/2023 2:42 PM] Minejerik#2582
Technically


[04/21/2023 2:42 PM] Minejerik#2582
A vpn doesn‚Äôt help much


[04/21/2023 2:42 PM] Minejerik#2582
Its just false advertising


[04/21/2023 2:43 PM] Minejerik#2582
I have a vpn just so I can watch stuff on Netflix I can‚Äôt here


[04/21/2023 2:45 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
Oh


[04/21/2023 2:45 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
Watch them fix the security a few weeks before we graduate


[04/21/2023 2:47 PM] Thememer_77#5107
yea Im just concerned because if he gets caught then we might be liable even though we dident do anything


[04/21/2023 2:48 PM] Thememer_77#5107
ya know


[04/21/2023 2:55 PM] Minejerik#2582
here‚Äôs the thing


[04/21/2023 2:55 PM] Minejerik#2582
Worst case for me


[04/21/2023 2:55 PM] Minejerik#2582
Is very little


[04/21/2023 2:55 PM] Minejerik#2582
As I‚Äôm not stealing info


[04/21/2023 2:55 PM] Minejerik#2582
Or doing damage to the system


[04/21/2023 2:55 PM] Minejerik#2582
And I‚Äôm a minor


[04/21/2023 2:56 PM] Minejerik#2582
So it wouldn‚Äôt go on my record


[04/21/2023 2:56 PM] Minejerik#2582
That would suck


[04/21/2023 2:56 PM] Minejerik#2582
But it would be good in the long run


[04/21/2023 2:56 PM] Thememer_77#5107
mkay but what about us?


[04/21/2023 2:56 PM] Minejerik#2582
If I


[04/21/2023 2:56 PM] Minejerik#2582
The person doing the ‚Äúhacking‚Äù


[04/21/2023 2:56 PM] Minejerik#2582
Would nearly get anything


[04/21/2023 2:57 PM] Minejerik#2582
Chances are


[04/21/2023 2:57 PM] Minejerik#2582
You wouldn‚Äôt get jack


[04/21/2023 2:57 PM] Minejerik#2582

[04/21/2023 2:57 PM] Minejerik#2582
May or may not


[04/21/2023 2:57 PM] Minejerik#2582
For a reason


[04/21/2023 2:57 PM] Minejerik#2582
Because I could say


[04/21/2023 2:57 PM] Minejerik#2582
I just lied to you guys


[04/21/2023 2:58 PM] Minejerik#2582

[04/21/2023 2:58 PM] Thememer_77#5107

[04/21/2023 2:58 PM] Minejerik#2582

[04/21/2023 3:09 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
You realize that they would have to go through years worth of chats and conversations


[04/21/2023 3:09 PM] Thememer_77#5107
Yea they would


[04/21/2023 3:10 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
Nobody has the patience


[04/21/2023 3:10 PM] Thememer_77#5107
they most likely have robots that do it in seconds


[04/21/2023 3:10 PM] Thememer_77#5107
or just filer certain words


[04/21/2023 3:11 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
True

[04/30/2023 1:02 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
What if you could mix discs together with an anvil or new block


[04/30/2023 1:03 PM] Thememer_77#5107
that would be cool


[04/30/2023 1:03 PM] Minejerik#2582

[04/30/2023 1:03 PM] Minejerik#2582
like would it splice the songs


[04/30/2023 1:03 PM] Minejerik#2582
or what


[04/30/2023 1:04 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
It could add more layers to the song


[04/30/2023 1:04 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
Maybe extentions


[04/30/2023 1:04 PM] Minejerik#2582
like combine the songs?


[04/30/2023 1:04 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
Or give it a different feel all together


[04/30/2023 1:04 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
Yes but not in a shitty way


[04/30/2023 1:05 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575

[05/02/2023 7:43 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
I will


[05/02/2023 7:43 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
actually


[05/02/2023 7:43 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
I have a better idea


[05/02/2023 7:43 PM] Thememer_77#5107
what


[05/02/2023 7:43 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
Before she checks


[05/02/2023 7:43 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
leave the gc


[05/02/2023 7:43 PM] Minejerik#2582
Should I just nuke the GC


[05/02/2023 7:43 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
then we invite you back


[05/02/2023 7:43 PM] Minejerik#2582
Make a family friendly one


[05/02/2023 7:43 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
yes


[05/02/2023 7:43 PM] Thememer_77#5107
Do that


[05/02/2023 7:44 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
also


[05/02/2023 7:44 PM] Minejerik#2582
Ok


[05/02/2023 7:44 PM] Thememer_77#5107
Name it happy go lucky pals


[05/02/2023 7:44 PM] Minejerik#2582
Ok


[05/02/2023 7:44 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
try to reason with her about the point cap


[05/02/2023 7:44 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
because 15 a week for those prices is unreasonable


[05/02/2023 7:44 PM] Thememer_77#5107
I did, thats when she double all the points to what they are now


[05/02/2023 7:45 PM] Minejerik#2582
Huh


[05/02/2023 7:45 PM] Minejerik#2582

[05/02/2023 7:45 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
we know


[05/02/2023 7:45 PM] Thememer_77#5107
No not at all


[05/02/2023 7:45 PM] Thememer_77#5107
IM gonna hide and mute this one


[05/02/2023 7:45 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
thats one thing if she leaves the prices alone


[05/02/2023 7:45 PM] Minejerik#2582
You know what you can do


[05/02/2023 7:45 PM] Thememer_77#5107
what


[05/02/2023 7:45 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
but when she decides to double them is when you're going too far


[05/02/2023 7:45 PM] Minejerik#2582
If you can install browser extensions


[05/02/2023 7:46 PM] Minejerik#2582
You can nuke all your messages in this GC


[05/02/2023 7:46 PM] Thememer_77#5107
No I need he to allow  EVERYTHING downloaded on my computer


[05/02/2023 7:46 PM] Minejerik#2582
Bruh


[05/02/2023 7:47 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
I'm losing braincells


[05/02/2023 7:47 PM] Thememer_77#5107
I have none


[05/02/2023 7:47 PM] Minejerik#2582
Give me a second


[05/02/2023 7:47 PM] Minejerik#2582
Nvm


[05/02/2023 7:48 PM] Thememer_77#5107
ok


[05/02/2023 7:48 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
I was looking back bc I was gone for a minute and if she did do that, we riot


[05/02/2023 7:49 PM] Minejerik#2582

[05/02/2023 7:49 PM] Minejerik#2582

[05/02/2023 7:49 PM] Minejerik#2582
l


[05/02/2023 7:49 PM] Minejerik#2582
change the name of the account


[05/02/2023 7:49 PM] Minejerik#2582
and transfer it


[05/02/2023 7:49 PM] Minejerik#2582
in worst case


[05/02/2023 7:50 PM] Thememer_77#5107
yea


[05/02/2023 7:50 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
because deleting HOURS upon **DAYS** worth of time and money is going too far


[05/02/2023 7:50 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
that's just personal at that point


[05/02/2023 7:51 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
remember this


[05/02/2023 7:51 PM] Thememer_77#5107
Oh trust me she has done worse


[05/02/2023 7:51 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
If you say something out of line


[05/02/2023 7:51 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
delete it


[05/02/2023 7:51 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575

[05/02/2023 7:52 PM] Thememer_77#5107

on the day that I was born


[05/03/2023 7:27 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
The nurses gathered around


[05/03/2023 7:28 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
And they gazed in wide wonder


[05/03/2023 7:28 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
At the joy they had found


[05/03/2023 7:28 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
The head nurse spoke up


[05/03/2023 7:29 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
Said, "Leave this one alone"


[05/03/2023 7:29 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
She could tell right away


[05/03/2023 7:29 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575

[05/16/2023 2:05 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
It takes them too much time to do simple things


[05/16/2023 2:35 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
Also can they make more updates that don‚Äôt fuck over early game


[05/16/2023 2:35 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
Almost every update it gets harder to survive


[05/16/2023 2:36 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
It got so bad to the point that newer players had to pay for dungeons carries to even get by


[05/16/2023 2:37 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
And then they made dragon armor have a catacomb requirement that by the time you could use them, you would have way better options
