just a dupe stash that even a retard could find in 5 seconds


[07/27/2021 5:10 PM] mifz#0000
People in 5b5 hunt for bases much less than in 2b2t so I'm guessing around 500k should be good enough

mhm

there is no incentive to hunt for bases bc of the dupe


[07/27/2021 5:12 PM] mifz#0000
Yup


[07/27/2021 5:13 PM] mifz#0000
How long will it last?


[07/27/2021 5:13 PM] yeah#0263
at 500k prob a long time


[07/27/2021 5:13 PM] mifz#0000
I meant the dupe


[07/27/2021 5:15 PM] yeah#0263
oh


[07/27/2021 5:16 PM] yeah#0263
idk it got nerfed hard but i think maybe a year or so longer the dupe is built in so it does not work in regular minecraft


[07/27/2021 5:16 PM] mifz#0000
Oh


[07/27/2021 5:17 PM] mifz#0000
I wish I could've used the prime dupe


[07/27/2021 5:17 PM] mifz#0000
Would've been faster


[07/27/2021 5:17 PM] yeah#0263
yeah u could dupe stacks of shulkers in like 10 seconds


[07/27/2021 5:17 PM] yeah#0263
thats why 5b is a big pvp server because it doesnt mean anything if u lose stuff


[07/27/2021 5:17 PM] mifz#0000
Do u live in eu?

He said age as in amount of time alive, I am not the oldest person in those terms. But I did join very early on in Storm's whole server thing. And you've got to love the defamation

[07/28/2021 1:41 PM] mifz#0000
its ok now i just needed to decrease the elytra speed cuz low tps


[07/28/2021 1:45 PM] Wao0001 owns you#8116
kami and umm, salhack work together


[07/28/2021 1:45 PM] Wao0001 owns you#8116
but like


[07/28/2021 1:45 PM] Wao0001 owns you#8116
there both utilitys


[07/28/2021 1:45 PM] Wao0001 owns you#8116

wow

Oopsies


[07/30/2021 5:14 PM] jasper#1806
but dont try to really hack the server and take control of it xD


[07/30/2021 5:16 PM] nasa135#0000
well that usually gets you sued or put in jail


[07/30/2021 5:16 PM] nasa135#0000
that's illegal


[07/30/2021 5:17 PM] jasper#1806
It happened on 2b2t


[07/30/2021 5:17 PM] jasper#1806
But not really taking control


[07/30/2021 5:18 PM] jasper#1806
Some people made a bot that rebuilds parts of the map in a separate world based on player activity and in this way they could leak a lot of players cords


[07/30/2021 5:19 PM] jasper#1806
Here is a better explanation https://youtu.be/elqAh3GWRpA


[07/30/2021 5:19 PM] spirit#1065
yo thats hella smart


[07/30/2021 5:20 PM] nasa135#0000
yeah i saw that video that was pretty cool how they did that


[07/30/2021 5:20 PM] nasa135#0000
That's some corporate level hacking there.'


[07/30/2021 5:21 PM] jasper#1806
But also scary, imagine you travel millions of spawn and build a base to get your cords leaked by something like that


[07/30/2021 5:24 PM] jasper#1806
@nasa135 do you have a hack client?


[07/30/2021 6:03 PM] spirit#1065
yeah thats the point of the server


[07/30/2021 6:10 PM] jasper#1806
I dont think the point of the server is to leak every base that exists but ok


[07/30/2021 6:12 PM] jasper#1806
The reason i play on this server is for freedom to build whatever you want and having to protect yourself, but you simply cant do anything about such an exploit. only the server owner can fix this.

Almost heaven, West Virginia
Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River
Life is old there, older than the trees
Younger than the mountains, growin' like a breeze
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads
All my memories gather 'round her
Miner's lady, stranger to blue water
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads
I hear her voice in the mornin' hour, she calls me
The radio reminds me of my home far away
Drivin' down the road, I get a feelin'
That I should've been home yesterday, yesterday
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads
Take me home, (down) country roads
Take me home, (down) country roads

NEW 2B2T DUPE 2021 CACTUS DUPE *FITMC AND POPBOB APPROVED*
Hausemaster, the admin on the oldest anarchy server in Minecraft, will be patching this dupe soon so do it while you still can. Credit for this dupe goes to Fitmc and Popbob, as they were the ones who discovered it in the first place.

kits are cool.. shulkers of xp bottles and totems are better


[08/08/2021 7:44 PM] eisheth#8246

[08/08/2021 7:44 PM] eisheth#8246

[08/08/2021 7:47 PM] nictie#0000
im good.. im over 100k out. and ive found so many stashes.. yall suck at hiding ur stuff


[08/08/2021 7:47 PM] eisheth#8246
hashasdh


[08/08/2021 7:47 PM] nictie#0000
i may have blown up a few dupe stashes on the way out to 100k


[08/08/2021 7:47 PM] eisheth#8246
how far do you go off of the highway to find stashes


[08/08/2021 7:48 PM] nictie#0000
bruh.. sometimes its stupid close.. within 1200 of a highway


[08/08/2021 7:48 PM] eisheth#8246
oh em gee


[08/08/2021 7:48 PM] eisheth#8246
thats stupid close yes


[08/08/2021 7:48 PM] nictie#0000
good ones are on the diag axis too


[08/08/2021 7:48 PM] eisheth#8246
ahh true


[08/08/2021 7:48 PM] eisheth#8246
that kinda makes sense idk why


[08/08/2021 7:49 PM] nictie#0000
what ive noticed. and im ok sharing this. is that as you go along the nether highways. after 5k or so if theres a portal, theres usually a dupe stash on the other side somewhere


[08/08/2021 7:49 PM] eisheth#8246
ahh


[08/08/2021 7:50 PM] nictie#0000
as long as the server has been up, id bet 1000s are hidden


[08/08/2021 7:50 PM] nictie#0000
they are like.. little stashes, like 100 kits or so


[08/08/2021 7:50 PM] eisheth#8246
yk how some people go away from their portal after going to the overworld? ik you'd have to use newchunks to follow their tracks but what do you do if the chunk trail is scattered everywhere?


[08/08/2021 7:51 PM] eisheth#8246
i always find scattered tracks and its annoying af


[08/08/2021 7:51 PM] eisheth#8246
do you have any methods


[08/08/2021 7:51 PM] nictie#0000
i zig zag when i leave a portal to break up the chunk trail


[08/08/2021 7:51 PM] eisheth#8246
how does that help


[08/08/2021 7:51 PM] nictie#0000
i hope it does? lol


[08/08/2021 7:52 PM] eisheth#8246

fall off a 1 block height and hit the spacebar once.. ez


[08/09/2021 10:11 AM] PacketLimit#5331
if u keep flying in old chunks then set ur elytra speed to 2.50 or whatever the max speed is


[08/09/2021 10:11 AM] PacketLimit#5331
so u can get to places faster


[08/09/2021 10:12 AM] nictie#0000
ü§Ø never even thought i could adjust speed. 1.14 has been fine enough.. thx for that info

np


[08/09/2021 10:12 AM] PacketLimit#5331
btw in new chunks max speed is 2.00

my friend made a survival server


[08/09/2021 10:31 AM] PacketLimit#5331
and i have been having a ton of fun in it


[08/09/2021 10:31 AM] PacketLimit#5331
so i kinda took a break from 5b


[08/09/2021 10:32 AM] PacketLimit#5331
(btw i backdoored his server and he doesnt know lol)


[08/09/2021 10:32 AM] nictie#0000
and that.. is why you cant trust anyone


[08/09/2021 10:32 AM] PacketLimit#5331
yup


[08/09/2021 10:32 AM] PacketLimit#5331
i mean hes on tlauncher


[08/09/2021 10:32 AM] PacketLimit#5331
so its not hard to log into his acc


[08/09/2021 10:32 AM] nictie#0000
oh .. well. hes already backdoored lol


[08/09/2021 10:32 AM] PacketLimit#5331
just type in a username


[08/09/2021 10:32 AM] PacketLimit#5331
yeah


[08/09/2021 10:32 AM] nictie#0000
yea


[08/09/2021 10:33 AM] PacketLimit#5331
actually i dont think backdoored is the right word


[08/09/2021 10:33 AM] nictie#0000
no.. its just fucking broken


[08/09/2021 10:33 AM] PacketLimit#5331
i logged into his account, gave myself op and yeah


[08/09/2021 10:33 AM] PacketLimit#5331
yeah


[08/09/2021 10:33 AM] PacketLimit#5331
if somebody is on tlauncher, all u need is their username then u can log into their account


[08/09/2021 10:33 AM] PacketLimit#5331
thats why u dont use tlauncher


[08/09/2021 10:33 AM] nictie#0000
i used tlauncher once.. had to format my pc and reinstall windows


[08/09/2021 10:34 AM] PacketLimit#5331
oh damn


[08/09/2021 10:34 AM] nictie#0000

[08/09/2021 10:34 AM] PacketLimit#5331
yeah true


[08/09/2021 10:34 AM] nictie#0000
its kinda why i dont trust many clients outside of impact lately. i just dont know


[08/09/2021 10:34 AM] PacketLimit#5331
tlauncher works fine on my pc but it lags the hell out of my laptop


[08/09/2021 10:34 AM] PacketLimit#5331

Pizza Tower OST - Thousand March (WAR)
War rages on, an entire army of pizza creatures against two chefs and a rat. 

I do not own the music. Pizza tower composers are Mr. Sauceman, ClascyJitto(Frostix) and POST ELVIS.
Pizza tower belongs to Tour De Pizza.

Come on, just buy the soundtrack!! You know you want it!

Btw, have the devs said about how the game is going to be updated on steam? It'd be a shame to not have the "experimental" releases on there


[02/11/2016 6:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
They explained everything in the blog post. There's gonna be no experimental releases AFAIK. And as for you @colonelwill , my boss hasn't paid me yet, so I have yet to be able to get your surprise

@weedsmokers nice


[02/18/2016 2:48 AM] timahh13#0000
@everyone I think it would be nice to run  this world as marathon mod with maybe some utility mods, I could run the server possibly if it was only 2-3 people as ,y computer isnt the best and more than that may cause frame or game lag issues. and the only way i would be abe to run it is through Evolve HQ as my router cannot port forward. So let me know. I will be able to play tomorrow so send a @timahh13 message if you are interested. I hope this will be fun üòÉ

What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I‚Äôll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I‚Äôve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I‚Äôm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You‚Äôre fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that‚Äôs just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little ‚Äúclever‚Äù comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn‚Äôt, you didn‚Äôt, and now you‚Äôre paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You‚Äôre fucking dead, kiddo.

does production +10% mean input cost *= 1/1.1 or input cost *= 0.9


[02/26/2016 3:16 AM] MeSaber#3810
aint that output ?


[02/26/2016 3:16 AM] timahh13#0000
it means the the output =1.1* input


[02/26/2016 3:16 AM] MeSaber#3810
so same input but 10% more output.. right? üòÉ


[02/26/2016 3:17 AM] MeSaber#3810

[02/27/2016 4:03 PM] Gandalf#0731
I keep getting error messages, such as "Couldn't establish network communication with server."


[02/27/2016 4:03 PM] Gandalf#0731
I've setup logmein hamachi, and im connecting with the ip it gives me


[02/27/2016 4:03 PM] Gandalf#0731
But it keeps showing that


[02/27/2016 4:04 PM] _regam#0000
You both have hamachi and are in the same network, right?


[02/27/2016 4:04 PM] Gandalf#0731
We are in the same network


[02/27/2016 4:05 PM] _regam#0000
Are you able to ping each other through hamachi?

:/ that's a shame


[02/27/2016 4:37 PM] Mini#3801
The problem is hamachi, it doesn't work very well, try and use evolve


[02/27/2016 5:12 PM] Shakaman#7298
Anyone else can't connect to the servers? asking for an update


[02/27/2016 5:15 PM] Mini#3801
which servers?


[02/27/2016 5:15 PM] Mini#3801
Steam or Factorio?


[02/27/2016 5:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
is it still p2p


[02/27/2016 5:36 PM] Shakaman#7298
factorio


[02/27/2016 5:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
yeah


[02/27/2016 5:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
wiki says it uses peer to peer


[02/27/2016 5:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
but the headless has an explicit option for it


[02/27/2016 5:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
giving the impression its not default


[02/27/2016 5:37 PM] Mini#3801
Yeah it's p2p


[02/27/2016 5:37 PM] Mini#3801
If you have really bad internet just increase latency


[02/27/2016 6:30 PM] _regam#0000
Without headless mode you can choose if it's going to be p2p or act like a normal server, but you can't use p2p when using headless servers


[02/27/2016 6:44 PM] timahh13#0000
@Mini SOrry about the dc last night my internet cut. Care to continue our game?


[02/27/2016 6:44 PM] Riglok#3876
So I have somewhere around 1,500 and 2,000 hours into the game and I've never used RSO (Resource Spawner Overhaul). Anyone recommend it, pros/cons?


[02/27/2016 6:44 PM] timahh13#0000
RSO make the game alot more difficult


[02/27/2016 6:44 PM] timahh13#0000
and you require a larger train network


[02/27/2016 6:45 PM] timahh13#0000
but it is equally rewarding as well


[02/27/2016 6:45 PM] Riglok#3876
Well I usually end up making fairly large train networks anyway, would it just make me need to do this sooner?


[02/27/2016 6:46 PM] timahh13#0000
well basically RSO just spreads ores out to be one patch every 50 squares or so


[02/27/2016 6:46 PM] timahh13#0000
maybe 40


[02/27/2016 6:46 PM] timahh13#0000
not sure


[02/27/2016 6:46 PM] timahh13#0000
this is an approximate btw


[02/27/2016 6:50 PM] Riglok#3876

You can always check out the factorio subreddit, reddit.com/r/factorio

[02/28/2016 4:32 AM] Gandalf#0731
And certain streamers, such as ColonelWill are really good at factorio, so you could always watch their streams


[02/28/2016 4:32 AM] Mini#3801

heaps of people that are experts are in the chat


[02/28/2016 4:33 AM] Mini#3801
just ask them


[02/28/2016 4:33 AM] Gandalf#0731
I still feel so bad at factorio, even though I have 20+ hours in it


[02/28/2016 4:33 AM] Mini#3801
hehe 20


[02/28/2016 4:33 AM] Gandalf#0731
Really shows you the difference between factorio and other games


[02/28/2016 4:34 AM] Mini#3801
I'm still learning new stuff at 1000 hours


[02/28/2016 4:34 AM] Gandalf#0731
I think that's whats amazing about factorio


[02/28/2016 4:34 AM] Gandalf#0731
You can get 1000 hours in it, and still not know everything


[02/28/2016 4:34 AM] Mini#3801
Even the devs don't know everything

factorioblueprint.com = madzuri = belt king


[02/28/2016 4:36 AM] Gandalf#0731
Also, factorio is really easy to mod


[02/28/2016 4:36 AM] Gandalf#0731
Not a lot of people realize that, it's just copying and pasting and changing the name basically


[02/28/2016 4:37 AM] Mini#3801
Not even changing the name üòâ


[02/28/2016 4:37 AM] Mini#3801
I modded my game so that pollution is a nice blue


[02/28/2016 4:37 AM] Mini#3801
I made someelses toxic green


[02/28/2016 4:37 AM] Gandalf#0731
That sounds cool


[02/28/2016 4:37 AM] Mini#3801
Better asethetic


[02/28/2016 4:37 AM] Gandalf#0731
I've only made mods like More Changes, you heard of that? I don't expect you to


[02/28/2016 4:38 AM] Gandalf#0731
It's a mod I made a couple of months ago, where it has a config file where you can have options to change gameplay, I prefer making stuff like that


[02/28/2016 4:38 AM] Mini#3801
No, couldnt find it

Anyone playing bobs mod who got the Cobaltite ore working?


[02/28/2016 9:51 AM] Gandalf#0731
I don't play bobs mods, but I thought the ore was replaced by a recipe


[02/28/2016 9:52 AM] Shakaman#7298
Yeah but it's annoying to setup xD

Anyone looking for players for multi?


[02/28/2016 10:23 AM] Gandalf#0731
I would be looking for multi-player


[02/28/2016 10:23 AM] Gandalf#0731
But it hasn't worked in the past, so you might have to face some technical challenges to get it working üòê


[02/28/2016 10:29 AM] northstrider#0000
Ah dang :/


[02/28/2016 10:29 AM] northstrider#0000
Just bought the game last night so I'm not too familiar with all the problems its facing atm


[02/28/2016 10:29 AM] northstrider#0000
You guys should post screenshots of your production lines if you think they're clever, mine are horribly managed =p


[02/28/2016 10:30 AM] Gandalf#0731
It might have just been with the other person


[02/28/2016 10:30 AM] Gandalf#0731
We can try if you like


[02/28/2016 10:30 AM] northstrider#0000
Sure, do you have a mic? We can move into one of the server chanels


[02/28/2016 11:25 AM] ceraphix#0000
Did you guys get it working?


[02/28/2016 11:27 AM] Gandalf#0731
Us 2?


[02/28/2016 11:29 AM] ceraphix#0000
Mhm.


[02/28/2016 11:29 AM] Gandalf#0731
I think so, we can connect, but we're  trying to reduce the latency a bit


[02/28/2016 11:29 AM] Gandalf#0731
As it's england to the US


[02/28/2016 11:29 AM] ceraphix#0000
Ahh. That shouldn't be too bad then.


[02/28/2016 11:30 AM] ceraphix#0000
Let me know if you want another player. üòÉ


[02/28/2016 1:07 PM] Shakaman#7298
Oh nice you got it working, did you have the same problem as we did?


[02/28/2016 1:08 PM] Gandalf#0731
I don't know


[02/28/2016 1:08 PM] Gandalf#0731
But I opened up my port on my router and allowed it in my firewall, and it worked


[02/28/2016 1:08 PM] Gandalf#0731
I could try it later, I'm playing a different gameright now


[02/28/2016 1:57 PM] rautapalli#0000
I haven't had any issues with multiplayer, just gotta forward the port 34197 and it should work fine


[02/28/2016 1:58 PM] rautapalli#0000
no need to use hamachi/evolve w/e if you're comfortable giving your ip out


[02/28/2016 3:08 PM] MeSaber#3810
someone know why port triggering dont work with factorio?


[02/28/2016 3:08 PM] MeSaber#3810
works fine with port forward but not triggering O.o


[02/28/2016 3:09 PM] MeSaber#3810
i trigger all other games i play thats why i wonder üòÑ


[02/28/2016 3:22 PM] para.dise.#0000
Does pollution mess with the amount of energy gained from solar panels/


[02/28/2016 3:22 PM] para.dise.#0000

@para.dise. Pollution has zero effect on solar panels.

@Riglok Thanks!


[02/28/2016 3:55 PM] Riglok#3876
If anyones looking for some help just lemme know. Have a couple thousand hours in üòÉ


[02/28/2016 3:57 PM] MeSaber#3810
1000 hours? thats longer than ive seen some people play dota2 üòÑ


[02/28/2016 3:57 PM] Riglok#3876
little over 2k


[02/28/2016 3:58 PM] MeSaber#3810
breaking it down 1000 days by 8 hours daily is 125 days.. sounds reasonable


[02/28/2016 3:58 PM] Gandalf#0731
And then there's me, with 20-30 hours


[02/28/2016 3:58 PM] Riglok#3876
It picked it up a few months after it was released in beta about 3 years ago


[02/28/2016 3:59 PM] MeSaber#3810
didnt know its been in beta that far..


[02/28/2016 3:59 PM] MeSaber#3810
sick amount of time


[02/28/2016 3:59 PM] MeSaber#3810
still the multiplayer performance is crap üòÑ


[02/28/2016 3:59 PM] Gandalf#0731
Not really


[02/28/2016 3:59 PM] Gandalf#0731
I'm getting good results with the same country and default latency


[02/28/2016 3:59 PM] MeSaber#3810
its 2016 and the multiplayer is unplayable unless ure in the same country more or less (and dont want max latency set)


[02/28/2016 3:59 PM] MeSaber#3810
yes same country i understand


[02/28/2016 3:59 PM] Gandalf#0731
Not really


[02/28/2016 4:00 PM] Riglok#3876
That's typical for any game now adays


[02/28/2016 4:00 PM] MeSaber#3810
if that wouldnt be below 249 id be surprised ^^


[02/28/2016 4:00 PM] Riglok#3876
it's p2p so it depends on you're internet more than anything


[02/28/2016 4:00 PM] Gandalf#0731
I played with someone from the US (I'm in england) and played with 300 latency


[02/28/2016 4:00 PM] Gandalf#0731
And I've got rubbish internet


[02/28/2016 4:00 PM] MeSaber#3810

[02/28/2016 4:00 PM] MeSaber#3810
just saying building a game with udp, making it unstable with p2p use in 2016 is silly üòÉ


[02/28/2016 4:01 PM] MeSaber#3810
anyhow the singleplayer is awesome


[02/28/2016 4:01 PM] MeSaber#3810
though nowadays its all about interaction with other players


[02/28/2016 4:01 PM] MeSaber#3810
which is why you want a fully functional multiplayer in most games you play üòâ


[02/28/2016 4:01 PM] MeSaber#3810
have they fixed the desync errors yet?

[02/29/2016 6:36 AM] para.dise.#0000

[02/29/2016 6:37 AM] para.dise.#0000

[02/29/2016 6:37 AM] Mini#3801

Factorio is becoming really popular now


[02/29/2016 11:25 AM] Gandalf#0731
Trending on reddit, one of the highest rated games on steam, etc.


[02/29/2016 11:38 AM] ceraphix#0000
That's awesome! If anyone wants to join me for some multi-player in about 5.5 hours on stream, let me know. ^^


[02/29/2016 11:38 AM] Gandalf#0731
Any mods?


[02/29/2016 11:39 AM] ceraphix#0000
What would you like? I use a few helper mods.. Smart trains, more light, autofill.


[02/29/2016 11:40 AM] Gandalf#0731
I wouldn't mind, I like using a few mods like that aswell


[02/29/2016 11:40 AM] ceraphix#0000
Perfect. :D


[02/29/2016 11:40 AM] Gandalf#0731
But I'd only be able to play for an hour or two at that time :/


[02/29/2016 11:41 AM] ceraphix#0000
That's okay. I usually only stream for about 2 hours.


[02/29/2016 1:34 PM] _regam#0000
Does anyone remember how to change a players force?


[02/29/2016 1:34 PM] _regam#0000
I can't remember nor find how to do it >_>


[02/29/2016 1:37 PM] _regam#0000
Nvm, finally worked it out lol


[02/29/2016 4:09 PM] Gandalf#0731
I'm just watching the factorio speedrun stream, and it just amazes me how fast people can finish the game


[02/29/2016 4:13 PM] MeSaber#3810
well its all planned though


[02/29/2016 4:13 PM] MeSaber#3810
its not random seed


[02/29/2016 4:13 PM] Gandalf#0731
I know, but it's just the fact that it takes me 60 hours to finish a game


[02/29/2016 4:14 PM] Gandalf#0731
And it takes some people 2 hours, even without a random seed


[02/29/2016 4:14 PM] MeSaber#3810
antielitz 2:26 seeded


[02/29/2016 4:14 PM] MeSaber#3810
wr so far.. im still to see a random seeded run


[02/29/2016 4:14 PM] MeSaber#3810
it would be epic (but long)


[02/29/2016 4:14 PM] Gandalf#0731
He's going for 2:22 seeded this time


[02/29/2016 4:15 PM] Gandalf#0731
Well, 2:22:56


[02/29/2016 4:15 PM] MeSaber#3810
ah yea.. sorry thats his new record


[02/29/2016 4:15 PM] MeSaber#3810
2:26 was the old one


[02/29/2016 4:15 PM] MeSaber#3810
however its fun to see how he changes his strats for each run


[02/29/2016 4:15 PM] MeSaber#3810
he keeps improving his layout üòÉ


[02/29/2016 4:16 PM] Gandalf#0731

[02/29/2016 4:16 PM] Gandalf#0731
It's not really a sustainable factory though


[02/29/2016 4:16 PM] MeSaber#3810
well its only built for rocket ^^


[02/29/2016 4:16 PM] Gandalf#0731
That's the thing, if you tried to get a rocket quickly with a normal factory, it would take a lot longer


[02/29/2016 4:17 PM] MeSaber#3810
indeed


[02/29/2016 4:17 PM] MeSaber#3810
i dont know how everyone else plays factorio


[02/29/2016 4:17 PM] MeSaber#3810
but ive only yet played on normal settings


[02/29/2016 4:17 PM] Gandalf#0731
I place stuff down and cry at how bad it is


[02/29/2016 4:17 PM] Gandalf#0731
Is that not how everyone plays? üòõ


[02/29/2016 4:17 PM] MeSaber#3810
so i havent had huge piles of iron i.e


[02/29/2016 4:17 PM] MeSaber#3810
no idea


[02/29/2016 4:18 PM] MeSaber#3810
all i know is that its simpler to have much iron compared to none ^^


[02/29/2016 4:18 PM] Gandalf#0731
I like the game, but not the resource problem


[02/29/2016 4:18 PM] Gandalf#0731
So I use a couple of mods which make resources not a problem, ie. Insane Resources


[02/29/2016 4:18 PM] Gandalf#0731
Makes it so much easier, and personnaly, it makes it more fun aswell


[02/29/2016 4:19 PM] MeSaber#3810
id like to have the aliens attack more often with bigger stuff


[02/29/2016 4:19 PM] MeSaber#3810
and see behemoths üòÑ


[02/29/2016 4:19 PM] MeSaber#3810
even if they would reck me


[02/29/2016 4:19 PM] Gandalf#0731
Would it be possible to play with behemoths from the beggining


[02/29/2016 4:19 PM] MeSaber#3810
i guess if you modify some values


[02/29/2016 4:19 PM] Gandalf#0731
Let's say you stayed away from the bases, tried to reduce pollution as much as possible, until you have lots of turrets


[02/29/2016 4:20 PM] Gandalf#0731
Could you do it?


[02/29/2016 4:20 PM] MeSaber#3810
i havent mixtered anything with factorio files except the hotkeys


[02/29/2016 4:20 PM] Gandalf#0731
I've made a few mods, but they're all little additions


[02/29/2016 4:20 PM] Gandalf#0731
No major changes


[02/29/2016 4:20 PM] MeSaber#3810
all i know is that its near impossible to get behemoths to attack


[02/29/2016 4:20 PM] MeSaber#3810
as it require a pollution of 20k


[02/29/2016 4:20 PM] MeSaber#3810
which is not that easy to reach


[02/29/2016 4:20 PM] MeSaber#3810
(afaik)


[02/29/2016 4:20 PM] Gandalf#0731
Unless you make a megabase


[02/29/2016 4:20 PM] MeSaber#3810
yea


[02/29/2016 4:20 PM] MeSaber#3810
and that will take........ time üòÑ


[02/29/2016 4:21 PM] Gandalf#0731
I prefer making compact, efficient bases


[02/29/2016 4:21 PM] Gandalf#0731
And taking hours to figure out if it will even fit, nevermind work


[02/29/2016 4:21 PM] MeSaber#3810
thats one of the problems with factorio, though one could say in any game


[02/29/2016 4:21 PM] MeSaber#3810
lets say you placed the stuff out


[02/29/2016 4:21 PM] Gandalf#0731
I think it adds to the feel of the game though


[02/29/2016 4:21 PM] MeSaber#3810
pain in the assss


[02/29/2016 4:22 PM] Gandalf#0731
I might start working on a large, but basic mod


[02/29/2016 4:22 PM] Gandalf#0731
Just for personal use, really


[02/29/2016 4:22 PM] MeSaber#3810
example.. trying to play like antielitz.. will prove to be hard.. as he got everything planned in tile perfection


[02/29/2016 4:23 PM] MeSaber#3810
and im not in mood for planning on a4 paper atm ^^


[02/29/2016 4:23 PM] Gandalf#0731
Has he planned most of it out, or just the general spots of stuff?


[02/29/2016 4:23 PM] Gandalf#0731
I've never done any sort of speedrunning


[02/29/2016 4:23 PM] MeSaber#3810
everything is planned in perfect position ^^ more or less


[02/29/2016 4:23 PM] MeSaber#3810
if he gets something one tile wrong he needs to restart xD


[02/29/2016 4:23 PM] MeSaber#3810
(if its mid game)


[02/29/2016 4:23 PM] Gandalf#0731
üòÆ


[02/29/2016 4:23 PM] MeSaber#3810
if its early he will restart even if hes just slow


[02/29/2016 4:24 PM] Gandalf#0731
Sounds like a lot of work, imo


[02/29/2016 4:24 PM] MeSaber#3810
and if its late game i guess he will try to finish no matter if its a worse time


[02/29/2016 4:24 PM] MeSaber#3810
his biggest problem is that he plays only one day a week


[02/29/2016 4:24 PM] Jozias#2354
anyone playing multiplayer?


[02/29/2016 4:25 PM] MeSaber#3810
at least he streams one day a week.. no idea if he touches factorio inbetween. He speaks in the sense of like he havent touched the game since last week he streamed


[02/29/2016 4:25 PM] Gandalf#0731
I don't play factorio often


[02/29/2016 4:25 PM] Gandalf#0731
But when I do, it's for weeks at a time, 8 hours a day basically


[02/29/2016 4:25 PM] MeSaber#3810
üòÑ


[02/29/2016 4:25 PM] MeSaber#3810
thats some nice hours man

üòõ


[02/29/2016 4:26 PM] MeSaber#3810

[02/29/2016 4:26 PM] Gandalf#0731
And then I lose my save because I did a stupid üòê


[02/29/2016 4:26 PM] MeSaber#3810
factorio is a sturdy game indeed


[02/29/2016 4:27 PM] MeSaber#3810
however it takes some time getting into


[02/29/2016 4:27 PM] Gandalf#0731
I'm glad they've made the guide free


[02/29/2016 4:27 PM] Gandalf#0731
It'll really help with the new players


[02/29/2016 4:27 PM] MeSaber#3810

oh


[02/29/2016 4:28 PM] Gandalf#0731
The stragety guide Xterminator made


[02/29/2016 4:28 PM] Gandalf#0731
Factorio bought it and made it free


[02/29/2016 4:28 PM] MeSaber#3810
i do wish the factorio wiki would be more updated


[02/29/2016 4:28 PM] MeSaber#3810
it seems like very few peps is updating it


[02/29/2016 4:29 PM] Gandalf#0731
The modding tutorial hasn't been updated in ages


[02/29/2016 4:29 PM] Gandalf#0731
The only way to get into modding is by help from other modders, or looking at the game code itself


[02/29/2016 4:29 PM] MeSaber#3810
mm the factorio wiki might need some new peps


[02/29/2016 4:29 PM] MeSaber#3810
that likes to play the game and can update it with correct information


[02/29/2016 4:30 PM] MeSaber#3810
its also nice having people that have access to the code so they can get correct information about the mechanics of stuff


[02/29/2016 4:30 PM] MeSaber#3810
figuring out the formulaes by yourself aint fun üòÑ


[02/29/2016 4:30 PM] Gandalf#0731
Depends how much you play the game


[02/29/2016 4:30 PM] Gandalf#0731
For some people it would be easy, such as people with megabases


[02/29/2016 5:02 PM] _regam#0000
In the latest FFF they said about how it's gonna be much easier for them to keep the wiki updated now


[02/29/2016 5:03 PM] _regam#0000
They've made some program that trawls through their documentation or something like that


[02/29/2016 5:03 PM] Gandalf#0731
They're using that in the lua documentation


[02/29/2016 5:03 PM] Gandalf#0731
Really helpful with modding


[02/29/2016 5:10 PM] _regam#0000
So factorio is now the #1 most popular game on steam

I've decided I hate the factorio multiplayer, I cant wait until it's made better


[02/29/2016 5:13 PM] _regam#0000
What's wrong with it?


[02/29/2016 5:13 PM] Gandalf#0731
Same mods, same version, port opened, still wont work


[02/29/2016 5:15 PM] Gandalf#0731
Some times it works perfectly, others, no matter what you do, it doesnt work


[02/29/2016 5:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
Wow, that's amazing. Do you guys think it will stay there?


[02/29/2016 5:20 PM] Gandalf#0731
I'm not sure


[02/29/2016 5:21 PM] Gandalf#0731
Once it starts getting a lot of public players, who knows


[02/29/2016 5:21 PM] Gandalf#0731
At the minute, it's mostly people who bought it before steam


[02/29/2016 5:21 PM] _regam#0000
It'll definitely stay near the top for a long time, but I'm not so sure about staying #1.


[02/29/2016 5:22 PM] Deleted User#0000
If someone told me 3 years ago Factorio would surpass Portal 2 on steam, I wouldn't believe it


[02/29/2016 5:23 PM] Gandalf#0731
So what do you need to do for multiplayer


[02/29/2016 5:23 PM] Gandalf#0731
Open ports on router, and put the port on the end of the ip?


[02/29/2016 5:24 PM] _regam#0000
34197 is the port i always open, and I always tell people to connect to my ip with the port on the end


[02/29/2016 5:25 PM] Gandalf#0731
That's what we've done


[02/29/2016 5:25 PM] Gandalf#0731
But I'm getting errors, any idea?


[02/29/2016 5:25 PM] _regam#0000
Is it a specific error or just a general one?


[02/29/2016 5:25 PM] Gandalf#0731
"Couldn't establish network communication with server"


[02/29/2016 5:26 PM] _regam#0000
Are you able to ping each other at all with cmd?


[02/29/2016 5:26 PM] Gandalf#0731
Yep


[02/29/2016 5:26 PM] Gandalf#0731
I'm getting 100ms ping


[02/29/2016 5:27 PM] _regam#0000
Huh. Is that both of you able to ping or just one person?


[02/29/2016 5:28 PM] Gandalf#0731
We can ping each other


[02/29/2016 5:29 PM] _regam#0000
And I'm guessing the firewall is disabled for both of you?

Yes


[02/29/2016 6:29 PM] rautapalli#0000
you don't need to have the port at the end when using the default port


[02/29/2016 6:30 PM] rautapalli#0000
make sure you/your friend doesnt have a space before/after the ip in the input box @Gandalf


[02/29/2016 6:30 PM] rautapalli#0000
i noticed the gui likes to do that a lot...


[03/01/2016 12:09 AM] Mini#3801
@Gandalf not sure if you are still on. But I use evolve to play multiplayer. It allows you to not even have to manually open a port it does it automatically and gives you an ip to connect to. I'm pretty sure evolve works with most games as well


[03/01/2016 2:39 AM] vlking977#0000

Are there any big mods other than dytech or bobs mods?


[03/01/2016 11:29 AM] Gandalf#0731
That add the same amount of content as they do

[03/01/2016 11:45 AM] Gandalf#0731
Good, I'm still annoyed at factorio multiplayer though

How do I connect to the server?


[03/01/2016 11:48 AM] ceraphix#0000
I'd really like a mine craft style play. Where people can come in and given a semi random spot to get started. And can work together with others and use trains to exchange things, etc


[03/01/2016 11:49 AM] Gandalf#0731
But the problem is internet, if 1 person has bad internet it can ruin it for everyone


[03/01/2016 11:49 AM] ceraphix#0000
Instead of just a single player game that just adds people.


[03/01/2016 11:49 AM] ceraphix#0000
Well yeah.. But there's dedicated servers you can make.

@Gandalf i haven't seen any big mods aside from dytech and bobs. Is there a reason you don't want to try one of them?


[03/01/2016 11:58 AM] Gandalf#0731
I was just wondering if there was more variety, I find that kind of odd that there are only 2 large mods


[03/01/2016 11:59 AM] ceraphix#0000
Give it time. Now that it's on Steam I'm sure there will be more.

So like, I've been here since... 0.11? Whatever the version before MP was, but I've never actually done MP because none of my friends play factorio... finally completed the game (well, pretty close, rocket is 50% done) for the first time, anyone in US MP sometime...?

Jump into a car and just go to the end of it.

just concreted all my base + potential expansions

Made a limit formyself to nos use bots (includ personal bots)


[03/02/2016 10:43 AM] ceraphix#0000
That's what I want.. But using trains and sorting without bots was driving me insane. I couldn't figure out a great way to do it.


[03/02/2016 10:51 AM] Shakaman#7298
just use smart inserts


[03/02/2016 10:51 AM] Shakaman#7298
trai comes in, unload onto one belt


[03/02/2016 10:51 AM] Shakaman#7298
this belt goes in a s shape several time


[03/02/2016 10:52 AM] Shakaman#7298
have seven spaces between corners


[03/02/2016 10:52 AM] Shakaman#7298
get 1 belt in the middle of this for the type of material


[03/02/2016 10:52 AM] Shakaman#7298
then line is with inserts, chests, smart inserts (to pick what item you want)


[03/02/2016 10:52 AM] Shakaman#7298
or you could just sort things before they went into the train


[03/02/2016 10:52 AM] Shakaman#7298
and have seperate stations for each material

Is that Bobs or something?


[03/02/2016 11:10 AM] ceraphix#0000
I did that - and I have a system that kind of works... I just run into an issue when I'm not using much Copper for example, and it'll cause the entire line to get backed up and just sit there.


[03/02/2016 11:23 AM] ceraphix#0000
But then like.. that gets separated. Not where's it going?


[03/02/2016 1:03 PM] Shakaman#7298

when you're feeding furnaces


[03/03/2016 1:03 AM] Mini#3801
but I think they use more fuel than if you were to use normal inserters but if you run out of coal then you can not feed coal into the boilers


[03/03/2016 1:03 AM] Mini#3801
its a win/loss

I'm not sure


[03/03/2016 1:03 AM] Mini#3801
I've never done the math


[03/03/2016 1:05 AM] Mini#3801
It's better to use normal


[03/03/2016 1:05 AM] Mini#3801
but using burners are handy early game


[03/03/2016 1:05 AM] Mini#3801
basically develop your own style of the game


[03/03/2016 1:05 AM] Mini#3801
that's kinda the whole point of the game


[03/03/2016 1:07 AM] Mini#3801
@Deleted User does that explain it enough?


[03/03/2016 1:07 AM] Deleted User#0000
i think so


[03/03/2016 1:08 AM] Mini#3801
For really big bases where power isn't a problem (backup systems etc) i use normal or even fast inserter but early game where coal is an issue i use burners


[03/03/2016 1:20 AM] Azurelinctus#7689
@Deleted User I dont know the math but I have read that burner inserters do consume more coal directly then electric inserters do via the coal used to power the steam engines. I do know for sure that by using burner inserters that you can stave off negative feedback loop that occurs when electricity demand is higher then production, miner drills slow, producing less coal which inturn decreases power production and so forth inevitably there is not enough power for the electric inserters to feed the last coal on the belt and the whole thing shuts down. This of course only happens if you dont expand power production with consumption or dont watch your coal mines and plan ahead before they run out. In short though burner inserters do have the benefit of auto running again as soon as more coal comes on the line and not completly shutting down

@Mini  my friend and i want to play my screen says connected but his says "The party network could not be joined. Evolved could not initialize the virtual network connection. Make sure its installed and enabled"


[03/03/2016 1:36 AM] Mini#3801
When you installed evolve it should have installed a driver


[03/03/2016 1:36 AM] Mini#3801
If you are on windows 10 google evolve windows 10 fix


[03/03/2016 1:52 AM] gingerking69#0000
@Mini so he fixed it and then tried connect and couldn't establish communication with server for him?

hello there, pretty new to this game, is there any source where I can find numbers for parts of a production chain, so that it reaches 100% efficiency (ex: if you wanna have max efficiency creating steel plates you need x amount of ovens for y amount of electric drills)?

[03/04/2016 6:30 AM] .drbees#0000
questions: the main base is quite far away from the oil, do I need to place pumps along the length of the main pipeline in that case?
what's the correct way to deal with crude oil once it's extracted by the pumpjacks? pipe crude to the base and deal with it there?
currently the crude oil is processed and then the output goes into various tanks because I'm not sure what else to do with it, what are the 'standard' things to do with the outputs from chemical plants?


[03/04/2016 6:31 AM] .drbees#0000
it's my first game so not sure what you're meant to do with all the products really


[03/04/2016 6:38 AM] Shakaman#7298
just make sure you give yourself ALOT of spaace


[03/04/2016 6:39 AM] Shakaman#7298
and make sure you can expand everything


[03/04/2016 6:42 AM] Shakaman#7298
right now you can't make more batteries for example


[03/04/2016 6:42 AM] Shakaman#7298
so if you want to scale up so you can research things faster, you have to rebuild everything


[03/04/2016 7:36 AM] ceraphix#0000
Also, why not use underground pipes so that you can still get through there?


[03/04/2016 7:36 AM] ceraphix#0000
Also, good morning everyone. ^^


[03/04/2016 8:35 AM] Deleted User#0000
dont they also count as only one or two pipes in the flow rate limit

since I made them all next to each other


[03/04/2016 10:41 AM] ceraphix#0000
I was looking at this for quite awhile wondering the same thing..


[03/04/2016 10:42 AM] ceraphix#0000
The only way I could think of a way without bots, is to put fast inserters from chest to chest towards the end of the line and extract from a couple chests


[03/04/2016 10:51 AM] Shakaman#7298
no, the output is in the middle


[03/04/2016 10:51 AM] Shakaman#7298
the input is mixed


[03/04/2016 10:51 AM] Shakaman#7298
that way I don't have to juggle trains


[03/04/2016 10:51 AM] Shakaman#7298
and can just have X unload stations


[03/04/2016 11:02 AM] ceraphix#0000
Show me more screenshots. üòÉ Since you have ..15? lines, I'd split them into groups of 4 with 2 spaces in the middle. It'll help reduce a lot of issues in the middle.


[03/04/2016 11:05 AM] Shakaman#7298
this is very much a WIP


[03/04/2016 11:05 AM] Shakaman#7298
but nothing is being used atm, still have the old base


[03/04/2016 11:06 AM] ceraphix#0000
That's okay. I like the look of it a lot! I just started a Bobs playthrough on Wednesday for the first time, too. And I love seeing peoples creations.


[03/04/2016 11:07 AM] Shakaman#7298
so currently I'm challenging myself, no bots, no construction robots, no plans etc


[03/04/2016 11:08 AM] Shakaman#7298
so trains, tracks and inserters


[03/04/2016 11:10 AM] ceraphix#0000
That's my goal as well!


[03/04/2016 11:11 AM] ceraphix#0000

just hit the new game button right ?


[03/04/2016 4:43 PM] Azurelinctus#7689
yeh, try just normal settings at first

Yeah, was about to say holy balls these settings


[03/04/2016 4:43 PM] Azurelinctus#7689
then you will see if you want more biters or less rescources or whatever

@ceraphix Hey, I saw your modslist, how have you gotten the rail tanker to work? For me it wont even start the game when it is loaded.


[03/04/2016 9:27 PM] .k_one#0000
Default chat name should be dark blue so much easier on the eyes

Tried without mods earlier, same message.


[03/04/2016 9:31 PM] Freddo#7522

Of course I had the Base Mod enabled.


[03/04/2016 9:32 PM] Freddo#7522
Still getting an error.


[03/04/2016 9:33 PM] timahh13#0000
try redownloading the mod and reinstalling


[03/04/2016 9:34 PM] timahh13#0000
if that doesnt work delete your fac files KEEP YOUR SAVES and redownload, also make sure that you version of railtanker you have installed in compatible with 1.10


[03/04/2016 9:35 PM] Freddo#7522
I think I realised my mistake.


[03/04/2016 9:35 PM] Freddo#7522
The factoriomods.com website was not showing the most recent version of the mod.


[03/04/2016 9:36 PM] timahh13#0000
oh ok make sure it is compatible with 1.1.0


[03/04/2016 9:36 PM] Freddo#7522
There was a 1.1.2 version on the forum post linked.


[03/04/2016 9:36 PM] timahh13#0000
ok


[03/04/2016 10:05 PM] Freddo#7522

Does anyone have a rough list of the differences between these mods?

[03/05/2016 6:12 AM] .drbees#0000
what kind of scale is there that means the difficult of the game increases over time with the aliens?


[03/05/2016 6:12 AM] .drbees#0000
like, in peaceful mode I happily build to my heart's content, but I haven't played/survived long enough with alien aggression to tell


[03/05/2016 6:12 AM] .drbees#0000
do the bugs get stronger?


[03/05/2016 6:13 AM] Gandalf#0731
They do over time


[03/05/2016 6:13 AM] Gandalf#0731
Every time you destroy a biter nest, their evolution increases, and it also goes up with pollution


[03/05/2016 6:14 AM] Gandalf#0731
They go from small, to medium, to large to behemoth biters, each one getting stronger, and you also get spitters, which spit acid at your defenses from a distance


[03/05/2016 6:14 AM] Gandalf#0731
Also, you're the alien here, not the biters üòõ


[03/05/2016 6:49 AM] Freddo#7522
@ceraphix Yup. got it working.


[03/05/2016 7:53 AM] Deleted User#0000
do aliens prioritize by amount of pollution


[03/05/2016 7:53 AM] Deleted User#0000
like ifi you put all your radars and generators in one outpost


[03/05/2016 7:53 AM] Deleted User#0000
and fortify it


[03/05/2016 7:53 AM] Deleted User#0000
will they only attack that

man we need oil badly....


[03/05/2016 9:28 AM] ceraphix#0000
Lol, we do. Train with rail tanker I think would be the best move.


[03/05/2016 9:28 AM] montauk32#0000
jeah what ever helps... the oilfield in the north is good


[03/05/2016 9:30 AM] ceraphix#0000
We could barrel it, but I think a rail tanker with a seperate oil depot would be better.


[03/05/2016 9:30 AM] montauk32#0000
we got all the space and possebilitys its up to us üòâ


[03/05/2016 9:31 AM] montauk32#0000
maybe a staight line just right of the small lake to the east of the base...


[03/05/2016 9:32 AM] ceraphix#0000
I started the game up for some multiplayer, but I don't know how long I have.

@timahh13  how do you get maps with so much water around your starting point (assuming it's your starting point)


[03/05/2016 11:36 AM] _regam#0000
Terrain Segmentation set higher/lower than normal I think


[03/05/2016 11:36 AM] grafdyon#0000
so that only affects water?


[03/05/2016 11:37 AM] _regam#0000
Not quite sure what it does tbh, other than changing water generation


[03/05/2016 11:37 AM] grafdyon#0000
would be so nice to have, all those biters coming from everywhere


[03/05/2016 11:44 AM] grafdyon#0000

[03/05/2016 3:06 PM] Mini#3801
@grafdyon So water segmentation sets how big the continents and lakes are. If you set to big then it will mean that the lakes and land masses will be bigger than normal. If you set to low. Then the lakes will be smaller. If you set it to starting area only, then water will only spawn in your starting area - not a lot of difficulty. I personally use big. Really just play around with the settings and see what they do and which ones you like.  


[03/05/2016 3:06 PM] Mini#3801

[03/05/2016 3:08 PM] Mini#3801
Or there is a small button in between the two toolbars


[03/05/2016 3:08 PM] grafdyon#0000
ye but pushing that every time would have been quite the hassle


[03/05/2016 3:08 PM] Mini#3801
You can change it in controls

It's your game. Customise it to suite you


[03/05/2016 3:10 PM] Mini#3801
Personally I like to set all the filters so all the items I need are in the same spot but I use my mouse to select the item I want to build then hit q to put it back where it belongs


[03/05/2016 3:15 PM] grafdyon#0000
do you have some ratios for pumpjack->...->plastic?


[03/05/2016 3:16 PM] grafdyon#0000
oh wait


[03/05/2016 6:58 PM] Mini#3801
@grafdyon you all good?


[03/05/2016 6:59 PM] Mini#3801
Its hard to get oil ratios because pumpjacks slowly lose oil


[03/05/2016 6:59 PM] Mini#3801
till they hit 0.1/s


[03/05/2016 6:59 PM] Mini#3801
I put production moduels in the pumpjacks then speed beacons all around to boost capabilites


[03/05/2016 7:12 PM] stark38#0000
How do I get these damn underground belts to connect?


[03/05/2016 7:30 PM] timahh13#0000
@grafdyon if you want more water change the frequency to be very high when you create a map, but mine was just on normal so it was randomly generated

[03/05/2016 10:00 PM] grafdyon#0000
ty @Mini  oil is kinda weird to begin with^^


[03/05/2016 11:05 PM] Mini#3801
Basically first of I use pumpjacks on all the oil i spawned with. Use 1 refinery for now to get some plastic through petroleum - 1 chemical plant should be fine for now and just store the light and heavy. Then setup 2 sulfurs and 1 sulfur dioxide and maybe 2 battery plants (basically just see what is the limiting factor and boost it - leave yourself heaps of room) setup some advanced circuits and then set up blue science - research advanced oil processing and switch the refinery to advanced oil processing (you will need water) and set up cracking (heavy to light and light to petroleum)

The ratio I use for cracking is 1-1-1 so 1 heavy to light then 1 light to petroleum. 
Eventually I get like 12 refineries, 3 heavy to light, 15 light to petrolum (1 for heavy 12 for the refineries) about 10 plastic and 10 sulfur maybe 5 sulfur dioxide and 10 batteries (I'm not sure about exact numbers but that is close to what I use.
I also have 1 lubricant for blue belts, splitters and electric engines

If you don't understand is it alright if I drop into your world?


[03/05/2016 11:08 PM] grafdyon#0000
that's pretty much what I am doing right now


[03/05/2016 11:08 PM] grafdyon#0000
how many pumpjacks does a refinery need at the beginning


[03/05/2016 11:09 PM] Mini#3801
depends on the yield of the oil well


[03/05/2016 11:09 PM] Mini#3801
just hook all the nearby oil wells


[03/05/2016 11:20 PM] Mini#3801
Usually 12 blue science assemblers for the ratio of science assemblers 5:6:12:2


[03/05/2016 11:21 PM] grafdyon#0000
5, 6, and 2 of what

hello, am I supposed to just "submit" repair packs to the logistics network or am I supposed to distribute them among the roboports?


[03/06/2016 5:56 AM] mzabsky#0000
It feels like the bots always fly all the way across the base to repair my stuff


[03/06/2016 6:11 AM] Deleted User#0000
a repair pack requester feeding into each roboport?


[03/06/2016 6:25 AM] timahh13#0000
@mzabsky what you do it you automate the creation of repair packs into a passive provider or storage chest. The consrution robots will take repair packs from the provider/chest


[03/06/2016 6:26 AM] mzabsky#0000
Yeah, that's what I have


[03/06/2016 6:26 AM] mzabsky#0000
But it takes ages for the bots to fly away to the chest hub and bring the packs


[03/06/2016 6:28 AM] timahh13#0000
thats just how robots work


[03/06/2016 6:28 AM] timahh13#0000
later you can research faster speeds and larger cargos

The repair packs don't need to be placed inside the roboport itself? That's good to know


[03/06/2016 7:28 AM] timahh13#0000

they give up if 
a) outside of roboport range
b) no materials
c) construction ghost expires (5 minutes)

what i did though was i used a solar, acculator, substation and roboport solar farm build where it was infintly expandable


[03/06/2016 8:34 AM] timahh13#0000
due to roboports


[03/06/2016 8:34 AM] timahh13#0000
and i had a automation setup for the materials needed to craft it


[03/06/2016 8:34 AM] Gandalf#0731

[03/06/2016 8:34 AM] Gandalf#0731

184 solar 154 acc 16 sub and 1 roboport. I then have a smart inserter set on the logi network to stop moving when (material)<# then i had a circuit network set up to tell me when i had enough materials to place another one (using lights) so i didnt have to check. Then if i started to run out of power i would just glance quickly. see that i had enough and go place another one down üòÉ

@Deleted User Did you get it balanced?


[03/06/2016 12:27 PM] Deleted User#0000
no


[03/06/2016 12:28 PM] ceraphix#0000
You can try balancing each line seperately?


[03/06/2016 12:28 PM] ceraphix#0000
Before combining them.

[03/07/2016 7:12 AM] wizardoforuz#0000
That's why I have the inserters set up the way they are.

I've never heard of it.


[03/07/2016 9:47 AM] wizardoforuz#0000
Link?


[03/07/2016 12:29 PM] ceraphix#0000
@wizardoforuz There's a couple things I would change about your layout there. Your iron and copper belts only have 1 space between them, which means you can't do much. And the inserter grabbing copper plates will soon not be able to keep up with the demand. Other than that, I like the layout. It still looks clean for the most part.


[03/07/2016 12:31 PM] wizardoforuz#0000
Which inserter? Do you mean the one that takes the plates off of the main line?
Would a splitter have been better?


[03/07/2016 12:31 PM] wizardoforuz#0000
And yeah, the one space is annoying, but I'm sure I can work around it.


[03/07/2016 12:35 PM] ceraphix#0000
You can work around it, you just have to mind the sides and take the iron/copper underground when splitting them in another direction, or like you did with the copper, take it under from the outside. A splitter would be better, especially in the beginning since a lot of your early things are going to rely on the circuits production being high.


[03/07/2016 12:38 PM] wizardoforuz#0000
Ahh, understood.


[03/07/2016 12:39 PM] wizardoforuz#0000
I can easily make another producer to make circuits that doesn't lead to the setup that makes inserters.


[03/07/2016 12:39 PM] wizardoforuz#0000
That'd help make sure the ciruit production is good.


[03/07/2016 12:41 PM] ceraphix#0000
Are the inserters and transport belt right there just for blue science?


[03/07/2016 12:41 PM] wizardoforuz#0000
Yep


[03/07/2016 12:41 PM] wizardoforuz#0000
And purple.


[03/07/2016 12:41 PM] ceraphix#0000
Er, green ><


[03/07/2016 12:42 PM] ceraphix#0000
I mean, the assembly machines making them.


[03/07/2016 12:42 PM] wizardoforuz#0000
Hmm?


[03/07/2016 12:42 PM] wizardoforuz#0000

[03/07/2016 12:42 PM] wizardoforuz#0000

[03/07/2016 12:42 PM] wizardoforuz#0000
And if I need them, I can easily collect them

No.
I can't exactly record, got no space really.

Oh, for Twitch, it's super easy. You just have it save your broadcast.

Oh, also, how many boilers for a starting engine?


[03/08/2016 11:13 AM] rabbit5740#0000
1.33 Boilers per Steam


[03/08/2016 11:14 AM] wizardoforuz#0000
I'll go with 10, sound good? Just for a single engine, but I can modify it.


[03/08/2016 11:14 AM] rabbit5740#0000
For a single steam engine? Way overkill and good way to increase pollution for no reason


[03/08/2016 11:15 AM] wizardoforuz#0000
Fair point, actually. 
Uhh... Ok then, just 2.


[03/08/2016 11:15 AM] wizardoforuz#0000
And pipes to ground to be able to add more boilers.

[03/08/2016 11:30 AM] Dylan#9615
Noob question: is it bad to have items on a transporter bell to the point where the items are no longer moving?


[03/08/2016 11:31 AM] Dylan#9615
I'm currently producing a lot of coal and iron with no real use for them yet, and I heard that storing them in a chest is a bad idea.


[03/08/2016 11:31 AM] rabbit5740#0000
nah, they aren't hurt just chilling on a belt


[03/08/2016 11:31 AM] rabbit5740#0000
chest isn't a bad idea either you will just have to get a arm to pull them out


[03/08/2016 11:32 AM] Dylan#9615
Alright, I see.


[03/08/2016 11:32 AM] Dylan#9615
It's just pretty worrying seeing your items do nothing


[03/08/2016 11:32 AM] rabbit5740#0000
it happens


[03/08/2016 11:32 AM] rabbit5740#0000

[03/08/2016 11:36 AM] ceraphix#0000
@Dylan I usually put the finished product in a chest so that it keeps going and then when it's set up later on, I just reverse the arm.


[03/08/2016 11:40 AM] wizardoforuz#0000
Yeah. Or I generally just have a splitter loop so that there's resources on both sides, which usually clears it up.


[03/08/2016 11:40 AM] wizardoforuz#0000
Though that can change, of course.


[03/08/2016 11:53 AM] ceraphix#0000
Yeah. I can share some screenshots of @montaku


[03/08/2016 11:53 AM] ceraphix#0000

[03/08/2016 12:16 PM] ceraphix#0000
I can't make it much bigger to see specifically.


[03/08/2016 12:18 PM] ceraphix#0000
So like, after it finishes going through all the sorting, it comes back to the beginning to go back through.


[03/08/2016 12:18 PM] Shakaman#7298
yep


[03/08/2016 12:18 PM] Shakaman#7298
but that is full also


[03/08/2016 12:18 PM] ceraphix#0000
Hmm... smelt it?


[03/08/2016 12:18 PM] Shakaman#7298
I can only smelt so much. Only found one use for it Zinc Plate


[03/08/2016 12:19 PM] ceraphix#0000
@montauk32 What did we need Zinc for again?


[03/08/2016 12:19 PM] Shakaman#7298
which in turn is only used by brass?


[03/08/2016 12:19 PM] ceraphix#0000
THAT.


[03/08/2016 12:19 PM] ceraphix#0000
That's what it was.


[03/08/2016 12:19 PM] Shakaman#7298
but I don't need more brass :/


[03/08/2016 12:19 PM] ceraphix#0000
So, I'd turn it into Zinc Plates, and store them for now.


[03/08/2016 12:19 PM] montauk32#0000
one of the mixed metals


[03/08/2016 12:20 PM] montauk32#0000
brass ..


[03/08/2016 12:20 PM] ceraphix#0000
That way at least it'll get the zinc off the line and not waste it.


[03/08/2016 12:20 PM] ceraphix#0000
Or, find a way to use up all your brass. üòõ


[03/08/2016 12:20 PM] Shakaman#7298
I can't fire it at the enemy xD


[03/08/2016 12:20 PM] montauk32#0000
and nxt time maybe use the RSO mod üòâ


[03/08/2016 12:21 PM] ceraphix#0000
RSO was definitely a great addition. I'm happy we have it.


[03/08/2016 12:22 PM] Shakaman#7298
one mod at a time üòõ just started with bob


[03/08/2016 12:23 PM] Shakaman#7298
never actually build outpost, ever


[03/08/2016 12:23 PM] montauk32#0000
bob is a complet overhaul not a mod... a mod is like using farl or maybe rso ...


[03/08/2016 12:23 PM] ceraphix#0000
Yeah, it's like a brand new game.


[03/08/2016 12:24 PM] ceraphix#0000
It's my first playthrough with it as well.


[03/08/2016 12:24 PM] montauk32#0000
... and keeoing out the newer bots is just keeping out the fun^^


[03/08/2016 12:24 PM] Shakaman#7298
I did my titanium and green tracks today, so much nicer when I need to transport things


[03/08/2016 12:25 PM] montauk32#0000
not using godmodules is okay but for a firsttimer i would use the hole pak;)


[03/08/2016 12:26 PM] Shakaman#7298
haven't used modules in this game either, so much more to do o.0


[03/08/2016 12:26 PM] montauk32#0000
just to see a factory running at insane speeds and production with all this bots flying around was fun^^


[03/08/2016 12:27 PM] montauk32#0000
the point when even express inserters can¬¥t keep up ... just great

I wonder what's the best way to get energy


[03/09/2016 7:30 AM] ceraphix#0000
Best way? Probably thousands of solar panels.

Depends on where you're at tech and resource wise.


[03/09/2016 7:40 AM] ceraphix#0000
You can run a 2nd set of steam engines next to the first, and you wouldn't need that much more space. You can use the same line of coal that you're already using as well. Assuming you have a normal setup.


[03/09/2016 8:37 AM] thacrypte#0000
LET me show you my setup


[03/09/2016 8:37 AM] thacrypte#0000

[03/09/2016 8:38 AM] ceraphix#0000

If you line up all your boilers and steam engines.you can just run a single coal belt for them all.

[03/09/2016 8:41 AM] ceraphix#0000
The ratio, I BELIEVE, is 14 boilers to 10 steam engines. I've heard 12.. 13.. and 14.


[03/09/2016 8:41 AM] thacrypte#0000
oh really?


[03/09/2016 8:42 AM] thacrypte#0000
But my map is a bit ... odd


[03/09/2016 8:42 AM] thacrypte#0000
it has water on both sides


[03/09/2016 8:42 AM] ceraphix#0000
Just move your entire steam engine section.


[03/09/2016 8:42 AM] ceraphix#0000
And then you'll free up space for that ore, too.

[03/09/2016 8:44 AM] ceraphix#0000
Here's what I would do..


[03/09/2016 8:44 AM] ceraphix#0000
That very bottom row - take the pipe and take it north almost directly from the water-pipe.


[03/09/2016 8:45 AM] ceraphix#0000
14 boilers - underground pipe for some space - 10 steam engines.


[03/09/2016 8:45 AM] ceraphix#0000
Then, it shouldn't block the copper and iron ore.


[03/09/2016 8:46 AM] thacrypte#0000
I'll make a new line here

[03/09/2016 8:46 AM] thacrypte#0000
cuz lots of space


[03/09/2016 8:46 AM] thacrypte#0000
for engine rows


[03/09/2016 8:47 AM] ceraphix#0000
You can do that too. üòÉ


[03/09/2016 8:48 AM] ceraphix#0000
I would also load balance that coal üòõ


[03/09/2016 8:48 AM] ceraphix#0000
Which just needs a splitter with 1 output.

Move your storage tank to the right. Build another chemical plant or two for the batteries below it. Output them onto a belt to the right.


[03/09/2016 9:25 AM] ceraphix#0000
Below your current battery plant, not below the storage tank.

well


[03/09/2016 9:26 AM] thacrypte#0000

Lubricant is definitely something you're going to need. The other thing you can do is research advanced oil processing and start turning heavy oil to light oil, and light oil to petro.

"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you‚Äôre watching this tape, I‚Äôm probably dead‚Äì murdered by my brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now, and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my fiftieth birthday, Hank came to me with a rather shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world, connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was astounded. I‚ÄìI always thought Hank was a very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time‚Äìsomething he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride-along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn‚Äôt want my family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head and, Hank had a partner named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn‚Äôt know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, of which Fring flatly refused to give it, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh, I guess‚Ä¶ I guess you call it a hit on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills, which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge. Working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me. And he gave me no option in that. I have often contemplated suicide, but I‚Äôm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened.

give me a second


[04/11/2023 8:45 PM] Thememer_77#5107
Hank had risen in the reigns to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time to keep me in line, he took my children from me, for three months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done. Why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. And I was in hell. I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me. Or worse, hurt my family. All I could think to do was to make this video and hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is."

What makes me a good demoman? If I were a bad demoman, I wouldn't be sittin' here discussin' it with you, now would I?! LET'S DO IT! Not one of you's gonna survive this! One crossed wire, one wayward pinch of potassium chlorate, one errant twitch, and KA-BLOOIE! nd I got a manky eye. I'm a black Scottish cyclops. They got more fecking sea monsters in the great Lochett Ness than they got the likes of me. So! T'all you fine dandies, so proud, so cocksure, prancin' about with your heads full of eyeballs... come and get me, I say! I'll be waitin' on you with a whiff of the old brimstone! I'm a Grimm bloody fable with an unhappy bloody end! Oh, they're going to have to glue you back together...IN HELL!

[04/14/2023 9:02 PM] Minejerik#2582
also not full utilization of ore patches


[04/14/2023 9:03 PM] Minejerik#2582

[04/14/2023 9:03 PM] Minejerik#2582
holy hell is it shit


[04/14/2023 9:03 PM] Minejerik#2582
very inefficient


[04/14/2023 9:04 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
a virus that's bad at its job


[04/14/2023 9:04 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
that's crazy


[04/14/2023 9:04 PM] Minejerik#2582

single threaded


[04/14/2023 9:04 PM] Minejerik#2582
pathetic


[04/14/2023 9:12 PM] Minejerik#2582
also it was just a shitty py2exe


[04/14/2023 9:12 PM] Minejerik#2582
which can be cracked easily


[04/14/2023 9:13 PM] Thememer_77#5107

[04/14/2023 9:13 PM] Minejerik#2582
which lets them control your mouse


[04/14/2023 9:13 PM] Minejerik#2582

[04/14/2023 9:13 PM] Minejerik#2582

[04/14/2023 9:33 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575

[04/14/2023 9:33 PM] Thememer_77#5107

[04/21/2023 2:39 PM] Minejerik#2582
I will email them from another email


[04/21/2023 2:39 PM] Minejerik#2582
After the prank


[04/21/2023 2:39 PM] Minejerik#2582
Telling them about how I did it


[04/21/2023 2:40 PM] Minejerik#2582
but I will stay anonymous


[04/21/2023 2:40 PM] Thememer_77#5107
mmhm


[04/21/2023 2:41 PM] Thememer_77#5107

[04/21/2023 2:41 PM] Minejerik#2582

[04/21/2023 2:41 PM] Minejerik#2582

[04/21/2023 2:41 PM] Thememer_77#5107
mkay


[04/21/2023 2:42 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
Make sure to use a vpn


[04/21/2023 2:42 PM] Minejerik#2582
Technically


[04/21/2023 2:42 PM] Minejerik#2582
A vpn doesn‚Äôt help much


[04/21/2023 2:42 PM] Minejerik#2582
Its just false advertising


[04/21/2023 2:43 PM] Minejerik#2582
I have a vpn just so I can watch stuff on Netflix I can‚Äôt here


[04/21/2023 2:45 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
Oh


[04/21/2023 2:45 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
Watch them fix the security a few weeks before we graduate


[04/21/2023 2:47 PM] Thememer_77#5107
yea Im just concerned because if he gets caught then we might be liable even though we dident do anything


[04/21/2023 2:48 PM] Thememer_77#5107
ya know


[04/21/2023 2:55 PM] Minejerik#2582
here‚Äôs the thing


[04/21/2023 2:55 PM] Minejerik#2582
Worst case for me


[04/21/2023 2:55 PM] Minejerik#2582
Is very little


[04/21/2023 2:55 PM] Minejerik#2582
As I‚Äôm not stealing info


[04/21/2023 2:55 PM] Minejerik#2582
Or doing damage to the system


[04/21/2023 2:55 PM] Minejerik#2582
And I‚Äôm a minor


[04/21/2023 2:56 PM] Minejerik#2582
So it wouldn‚Äôt go on my record


[04/21/2023 2:56 PM] Minejerik#2582
That would suck


[04/21/2023 2:56 PM] Minejerik#2582
But it would be good in the long run


[04/21/2023 2:56 PM] Thememer_77#5107
mkay but what about us?


[04/21/2023 2:56 PM] Minejerik#2582
If I


[04/21/2023 2:56 PM] Minejerik#2582
The person doing the ‚Äúhacking‚Äù


[04/21/2023 2:56 PM] Minejerik#2582
Would nearly get anything


[04/21/2023 2:57 PM] Minejerik#2582
Chances are


[04/21/2023 2:57 PM] Minejerik#2582
You wouldn‚Äôt get jack


[04/21/2023 2:57 PM] Minejerik#2582
Also


[04/21/2023 2:57 PM] Thememer_77#5107
mkay


[04/21/2023 2:57 PM] Minejerik#2582
I have been saying


[04/21/2023 2:57 PM] Thememer_77#5107
if you say so


[04/21/2023 2:57 PM] Minejerik#2582
May or may not


[04/21/2023 2:57 PM] Minejerik#2582
For a reason


[04/21/2023 2:57 PM] Minejerik#2582
Because I could say


[04/21/2023 2:57 PM] Minejerik#2582
I just lied to you guys


[04/21/2023 2:58 PM] Minejerik#2582
and faked some screenshots


[04/21/2023 2:58 PM] Thememer_77#5107
ok may but what if they read this chat?


[04/21/2023 2:58 PM] Minejerik#2582
shit


[04/21/2023 2:58 PM] Minejerik#2582
Also


[04/21/2023 2:58 PM] Minejerik#2582
The people who hacked their Highschool


[04/21/2023 2:59 PM] Minejerik#2582
Who weren‚Äôt minirs


[04/21/2023 2:59 PM] Minejerik#2582
Minions


[04/21/2023 2:59 PM] Minejerik#2582
Minions


[04/21/2023 2:59 PM] Minejerik#2582
Minors

[04/21/2023 2:59 PM] Minejerik#2582
And they affected 11k people in their siscrict


[04/21/2023 2:59 PM] Minejerik#2582
District


[04/21/2023 3:00 PM] Minejerik#2582
they hacked the district to play Rick roll


[04/21/2023 3:00 PM] Thememer_77#5107
ok


[04/21/2023 3:09 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
You realize that they would have to go through years worth of chats and conversations


[04/21/2023 3:09 PM] Thememer_77#5107
Yea they would


[04/21/2023 3:10 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
Nobody has the patience


[04/21/2023 3:10 PM] Thememer_77#5107
they most likely have robots that do it in seconds


[04/21/2023 3:10 PM] Thememer_77#5107
or just filer certain words


[04/21/2023 3:11 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
True


[04/21/2023 3:21 PM] Minejerik#2582

in their district


[04/21/2023 3:21 PM] Minejerik#2582
there just was no legal anything


[04/21/2023 3:21 PM] Minejerik#2582
police never came


[04/21/2023 3:21 PM] Thememer_77#5107

[04/21/2023 3:21 PM] Minejerik#2582
so you know


[04/21/2023 3:21 PM] Minejerik#2582

[04/21/2023 3:21 PM] Minejerik#2582
district is pissed at me


[04/21/2023 3:21 PM] Minejerik#2582

[04/21/2023 3:22 PM] Minejerik#2582

[04/21/2023 3:22 PM] Thememer_77#5107

[04/30/2023 1:03 PM] Minejerik#2582

or what


[04/30/2023 1:04 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
It could add more layers to the song


[04/30/2023 1:04 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
Maybe extentions


[04/30/2023 1:04 PM] Minejerik#2582
like combine the songs?


[04/30/2023 1:04 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
Or give it a different feel all together


[04/30/2023 1:04 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
Yes but not in a shitty way


[04/30/2023 1:05 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575

[05/02/2023 7:41 PM] Thememer_77#5107
Do you think he listens


[05/02/2023 7:41 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
find a way to blackmail him


[05/02/2023 7:41 PM] Minejerik#2582
Is this the Fortnite child


[05/02/2023 7:41 PM] Thememer_77#5107

[05/02/2023 7:42 PM] Thememer_77#5107
my mom is gonna go though our chats every week


[05/02/2023 7:42 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
we remake a new gc


[05/02/2023 7:43 PM] Minejerik#2582
You should delete everything referencing


[05/02/2023 7:43 PM] Minejerik#2582
Blackmail


[05/02/2023 7:43 PM] Thememer_77#5107
yea


[05/02/2023 7:43 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
I will


[05/02/2023 7:43 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
actually


[05/02/2023 7:43 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
I have a better idea


[05/02/2023 7:43 PM] Thememer_77#5107
what


[05/02/2023 7:43 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
Before she checks


[05/02/2023 7:43 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
leave the gc


[05/02/2023 7:43 PM] Minejerik#2582
Should I just nuke the GC


[05/02/2023 7:43 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
then we invite you back


[05/02/2023 7:43 PM] Minejerik#2582
Make a family friendly one


[05/02/2023 7:43 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
yes


[05/02/2023 7:43 PM] Thememer_77#5107
Do that


[05/02/2023 7:44 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
also


[05/02/2023 7:44 PM] Minejerik#2582
Ok


[05/02/2023 7:44 PM] Thememer_77#5107
Name it happy go lucky pals


[05/02/2023 7:44 PM] Minejerik#2582
Ok


[05/02/2023 7:44 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
try to reason with her about the point cap


[05/02/2023 7:44 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
because 15 a week for those prices is unreasonable


[05/02/2023 7:44 PM] Thememer_77#5107
I did, thats when she double all the points to what they are now


[05/02/2023 7:45 PM] Minejerik#2582
Huh


[05/02/2023 7:45 PM] Minejerik#2582

[05/02/2023 7:45 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
we know


[05/02/2023 7:45 PM] Thememer_77#5107
No not at all


[05/02/2023 7:45 PM] Thememer_77#5107
IM gonna hide and mute this one


[05/02/2023 7:45 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
thats one thing if she leaves the prices alone


[05/02/2023 7:45 PM] Minejerik#2582
You know what you can do


[05/02/2023 7:45 PM] Thememer_77#5107
what


[05/02/2023 7:45 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
but when she decides to double them is when you're going too far


[05/02/2023 7:45 PM] Minejerik#2582
If you can install browser extensions


[05/02/2023 7:46 PM] Minejerik#2582
You can nuke all your messages in this GC


[05/02/2023 7:46 PM] Thememer_77#5107
No I need he to allow  EVERYTHING downloaded on my computer


[05/02/2023 7:46 PM] Minejerik#2582
Bruh


[05/02/2023 7:47 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
I'm losing braincells


[05/02/2023 7:47 PM] Thememer_77#5107
I have none


[05/02/2023 7:47 PM] Minejerik#2582
Give me a second


[05/02/2023 7:47 PM] Minejerik#2582
Nvm


[05/02/2023 7:48 PM] Thememer_77#5107
ok


[05/02/2023 7:48 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
I was looking back bc I was gone for a minute and if she did do that, we riot


[05/02/2023 7:49 PM] Minejerik#2582
you know dom


[05/02/2023 7:49 PM] Minejerik#2582

l


[05/02/2023 7:49 PM] Minejerik#2582
change the name of the account


[05/02/2023 7:49 PM] Minejerik#2582
and transfer it


[05/02/2023 7:49 PM] Minejerik#2582
in worst case


[05/02/2023 7:50 PM] Thememer_77#5107
yea


[05/02/2023 7:50 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
because deleting HOURS upon **DAYS** worth of time and money is going too far


[05/02/2023 7:50 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
that's just personal at that point


[05/02/2023 7:51 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
remember this


[05/02/2023 7:51 PM] Thememer_77#5107
Oh trust me she has done worse


[05/02/2023 7:51 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
If you say something out of line


[05/02/2023 7:51 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
delete it


[05/02/2023 7:51 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
like what


[05/02/2023 7:52 PM] Thememer_77#5107

[05/02/2023 7:53 PM] Thememer_77#5107

[05/02/2023 7:54 PM] Thememer_77#5107

[05/02/2023 7:54 PM] Minejerik#2582

The nurses gathered around

[05/03/2023 7:28 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
At the joy they had found


[05/03/2023 7:28 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575

[05/03/2023 7:29 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
Said, "Leave this one alone"


[05/03/2023 7:29 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575

melon is very profitable even if it sells for less


[05/25/2023 9:18 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575

And I quickly sold it for the price I wanted and got a better Melon dicer 2.0


[05/26/2023 1:13 PM] WaluigiTransformed69#2575
With better enchants too
